Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone


CHAPTER ONE

THE BOY WHO LIVED

Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet/бирючина/ Drive, were proud to say
that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last
people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange/странный/ or mysterious,
because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.

Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made
drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck/шея/, although/несмотря на то что/ he did
have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin/тонкий/ and blonde and had
nearly twice the usual amount of neck/шея/, which came in very useful as she
spent/потраченный/ so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their
opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.

The Dursleys had everything/все/ they wanted, but they also had a secret, and
their greatest fear/страх/ was that somebody would discover it. They didn't
think they could bear it if anyone/кто угодно/ found out about the Potters. Mrs.
Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;
in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her
sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was
possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would
say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the
Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy
was another good reason for keeping/хранение/ the Potters away/далеко/; they didn't want
Dudley mixing with a child like that.

When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke/просыпался/ up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story
starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that
strange/странный/ and mysterious things would soon/скоро/ be happening all over the
country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked/выбрал/ out his most boring tie for
work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away/далеко/ happily as she wrestled a screaming
Dudley into his high chair.

None/никто/ of them noticed/заметил/ a large, tawny owl/сова/ flutter past the window.

At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked/выбрал/ up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.
Dursley on the cheek, and tried/пытался/ to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,
because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing/бросание/ his cereal at the
walls. "Little tyke," chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got
into his car and backed out of number four's drive.

It was on the corner of the street that he noticed/заметил/ the first sign of
something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley
didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked/рывком/ his head around to
look again. There was a tabby cat standing/постоянный/ on the corner of Privet/бирючина/
Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight/взгляд/. What could he have been thinking
of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and
stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the
corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now
reading the sign that said Privet/бирючина/ Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave/дал/ himself/сам/ a little shake and
put the cat out of his mind/разум/. As he drove toward/к/ town he thought/думал/ of
nothing except/Кроме/ a large order of drills he was hoping/надеясь/ to get that day.

But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind/разум/ by something
else. As he sat/сидел/ in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help
noticing that there seemed/казалось/ to be a lot of strangely dressed people
about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in
funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed/предполагаемый/ this
was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering
wheel and his eyes fell/упал/ on a huddle of these/эти/ weirdos standing/постоянный/ quite/довольно/
close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was
enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man
had to be older than he was, and wearing/носить/ an emerald-green cloak! The
nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably/вероятно/ some
silly stunt -- these/эти/ people were obviously/очевидно/ collecting for something...
yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr.
Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind/разум/ back on drills.

Mr. Dursley always sat/сидел/ with his back to the window in his office on the
ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate
on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls/совы/ swoop ing past in broad
daylight, though/хоть/ people down in the street did; they pointed/заостренный/ and gazed
open- mouthed as owl/сова/ after owl/сова/ sped overhead. Most of them had never
seen an owl/сова/ even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly
normal, owl/сова/-free morning. He yelled/вопил/ at five different people. He made
several important telephone calls and shouted/кричал/ a bit more. He was in a
very good mood until/до/ lunchtime, when he thought/думал/ he'd stretch his legs/ноги/
and walk across/через/ the road to buy himself/сам/ a bun from the bakery.

He'd forgotten/забытый/ all about the people in cloaks until/до/ he passed/прошло/ a group of
them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed/прошло/. He didn't
know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering
excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on
his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he
caught/пойманный/ a few words of what they were saying.

"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard/услышанным/ yes, their son, Harry"

Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear/страх/ flooded him. He looked back at the
whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought/думал/ better
of it.

He dashed back across/через/ the road, hurried/торопливый/ up to his office, snapped/щелкнул/ at his
secretary not to disturb him, seized/захватили/ his telephone, and had almost/почти/
finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind/разум/. He put the
receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was
being/являющийся/ stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were
lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think
of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even
seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point
in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her
sister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all
the same, those/те/ people in cloaks...

He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and
when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still/все еще/ so worried that
he walked straight/Прямо/ into someone/кто то/ just outside the door.

"Sorry," he grunted, as the tiny/крошечный/ old man stumbled and almost/почти/ fell/упал/. It
was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing/носить/ a
violet cloak. He didn't seem/казаться/ at all upset at being/являющийся/ almost/почти/ knocked/постучался/ to the
ground/земля/. On the contrary, his face split into a wide/широкий/ smile and he said in
a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, "Don't be sorry, my dear sir,
for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at
last! Even Muggles like yourself/сам/ should be celebrating, this happy,
happy day!"

And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.

Mr. Dursley stood/стоял/ rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete
stranger. He also thought/думал/ he had been called a Muggle, whatever/без разницы/ that
was. He was rattled. He hurried/торопливый/ to his car and set off for home, hoping/надеясь/
he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he
didn't approve of imagination.

As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw --
and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted/пятнистый/ that
morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the
same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.

"Shoo!" said Mr. Dursley loudly/громко/. The cat didn't move. It just gave/дал/ him a
stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered/задавались вопросом/. Trying
to pull himself/сам/ together, he let himself/сам/ into the house. He was still/все еще/
determined not to mention anything to his wife.

Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all
about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had
learned a new word ("Won/выиграл/'t!"). Mr. Dursley tried/пытался/ to act normally. When
Dudley had been put to bed, he went/отправился/ into the living room in time to
catch/поймать/ the last report on the evening news:

"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's
owls/совы/ have been behaving very unusually today. Although/несмотря на то что/ owls/совы/ normally
hunt at night and are hardly ever/Когда-либо/ seen in daylight, there have been
hundreds of sightings of these/эти/ birds flying in every direction since
sunrise. Experts are unable to explain/объяснять/ why the owls/совы/ have suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/
changed their sleeping pattern." The newscaster allowed himself/сам/ a grin.
"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going
to be any more showers of owls/совы/ tonight, Jim?"

"Well, Ted," said the weatherman, "I don't know about that, but it's not
only the owls/совы/ that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart/Кроме/ as
Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead
of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting
stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's
not until/до/ next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight."

Mr. Dursley sat/сидел/ frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?
Owls/совы/ flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place?
And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...

Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying/проведение/ two cups of tea. It was
no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat
nervously/нервно/. "Er/эр/ -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard/услышанным/ from your sister
lately, have you?"

As he had expected/ожидаемый/, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,
they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.

"No," she said sharply. "Why?"

"Funny stuff/материал/ on the news," Mr. Dursley mumbled. "Owls/совы/... shooting
stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today..."

"So?" snapped/щелкнул/ Mrs. Dursley.

"Well, I just thought/думал/... maybe... it was something to do with... you
know... her crowd/толпа/."

Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered/задавались вопросом/
whether he dared tell her he'd heard/услышанным/ the name "Potter." He decided/приняли решение/ he
didn't dare/сметь/. Instead he said, as casually as he could, "Their son --
he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?"

"I suppose/предполагать/ so," said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.

"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?"

"Harry. Nasty/противный/, common name, if you ask me."

"Oh, yes," said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. "Yes, I quite/довольно/
agree."

He didn't say another word on the subject as they went/отправился/ upstairs/вверх по лестнице/ to bed.
While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept/подкрался/ to the bedroom
window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still/все еще/ there.
It was staring/уставившись/ down Privet/бирючина/ Drive as though/хоть/ it were waiting for
something.

Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the
Potters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of
-- well, he didn't think he could bear it.

The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell/упал/ asleep/спящий/ quickly but Mr.
Dursley lay/прокладывать/ awake, turning/превращение/ it all over in his mind/разум/. His last, comforting
thought/думал/ before he fell/упал/ asleep/спящий/ was that even if the Potters were
involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs.
Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought/думал/ about
them and their kind.... He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get
mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned/оказалось/ over
-- it couldn't affect them....

How very wrong/неправильно/ he was.

Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat
on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as
still/все еще/ as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of
Privet/бирючина/ Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the
next street, nor when two owls/совы/ swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly
midnight before the cat moved at all.

A man appeared/появился/ on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared/появился/ so
suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ and silently you'd have thought/думал/ he'd just popped out of the
ground/земля/. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.

Nothing like this man had ever/Когда-либо/ been seen on Privet/бирючина/ Drive. He was tall,
thin/тонкий/, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard/борода/, which
were both long enough/достаточно/ to tuck into his belt. He was wearing/носить/ long robes/робы/,
a purple/пурпурный/ cloak that swept the ground/земля/, and high-heeled, buckled boots.
His blue eyes were light, bright/яркий/, and sparkling behind/за/ half-moon
spectacles and his nose/нос/ was very long and crooked, as though/хоть/ it had been
broken at least/наименее/ twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.

Albus Dumbledore didn't seem/казаться/ to realize that he had just arrived in a
street where everything/все/ from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was
busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem/казаться/ to
realize he was being/являющийся/ watched, because he looked up suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ at the cat,
which was still/все еще/ staring/уставившись/ at him from the other end of the street. For
some reason, the sight/взгляд/ of the cat seemed/казалось/ to amuse him. He chuckled and
muttered/пробормотал/, "I should have known."

He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket/карман/. It seemed/казалось/ to be a
silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held/Ручной/ it up in the air, and
clicked it. The nearest street lamp went/отправился/ out with a little pop. He
clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times
he clicked the Put-Outer, until/до/ the only lights left on the whole street
were two tiny/крошечный/ pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat
watching him. If anyone/кто угодно/ looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed
Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able/в состоянии/ to see anything that was happening
down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped/поскользнулся/ the Put-Outer back inside his
cloak and set off down the street toward/к/ number four, where he sat/сидел/ down
on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he
spoke/говорил/ to it.

"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall."

He turned/оказалось/ to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling
at a rather/скорее/ severe-looking woman who was wearing/носить/ square glasses exactly/в точку/
the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was
wearing/носить/ a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight
bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.

"How did you know it was me?" she asked.

"My dear Professor, I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly."

"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day," said
Professor McGonagall.

"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed/прошло/ a
dozen feasts and parties on my way here."

Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.

"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right," she said impatiently.
"You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles
have noticed/заметил/ something's going on. It was on their news." She jerked/рывком/ her
head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window. "I heard/услышанным/ it. Flocks
of owls/совы/... shooting stars.... Well, they're not completely stupid. They
were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I'll bet/делать ставку/
that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense."

"You can't blame them," said Dumbledore gently. "We've had precious
little to celebrate for eleven years."

"I know that," said Professor McGonagall irritably. "But that's no
reason to lose/потерять/ our heads/руководители/. People are being/являющийся/ downright careless, out on
the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes,
swapping rumors."

She threw/бросил/ a sharp/резкое/, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though/хоть/ hoping/надеясь/
he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went/отправился/ on. "A
fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have
disappeared/исчез/ at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose/предполагать/ he
really has gone, Dumbledore?"

"It certainly seems so," said Dumbledore. "We have much to be thankful
for. Would you care for a lemon drop?"

"A what?"

"A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather/скорее/ fond of"

"No, thank you," said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though/хоть/ she didn't
think this was the moment for lemon drops. "As I say, even if
You-Know-Who has gone -"

"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself/сам/ can call him
by his name? All this 'You- Know-Who' nonsense -- for eleven years I
have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name:
Voldemort." Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was
unsticking two lemon drops, seemed/казалось/ not to notice. "It all gets so
confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.' I have never seen any reason
to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.

"I know you haven 't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half
exasperated, half admiring. "But you're different. Everyone knows you're
the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of."

"You flatter me," said Dumbledore calmly. "Voldemort had powers I will
never have."

"Only because you're too -- well -- noble to use them."

"It's lucky/везучий/ it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey/Помфрей/
told me she liked my new earmuffs."

Professor McGonagall shot a sharp/резкое/ look at Dumbledore and said, "The owls/совы/
are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what
everyone's saying? About why he's disappeared/исчез/? About what finally
stopped him?"

It seemed/казалось/ that Professor McGonagall had reached/достиг/ the point she was most
anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard
wall all day, for neither/ни/ as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed
Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that
whatever/без разницы/ "everyone" was saying, she was not going to believe/верить/ it until/до/
Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing
another lemon drop and did not answer.

"What they're saying," she pressed on, "is that last night Voldemort
turned/оказалось/ up in Godric's Hollow. He went/отправился/ to find the Potters. The rumor is
that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they're -- dead. "

Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped/ахнула/.

"Lily and James... I can't believe/верить/ it... I didn't want to believe/верить/ it...
Oh, Albus..."

Dumbledore reached/достиг/ out and patted her on the shoulder. "I know... I
know..." he said heavily.

Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went/отправился/ on. "That's not all.
They're saying he tried/пытался/ to kill the Potter's son, Harry. But -- he
couldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how,
but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's
power somehow/как-то/ broke -- and that's why he's gone.

Dumbledore nodded/кивнул/ glumly.

"It's -- it's true?" faltered Professor McGonagall. "After all he's
done... all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill a little boy?
It's just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the
name of heaven did Harry survive?"

"We can only guess," said Dumbledore. "We may never know."

Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her
eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave/дал/ a great sniff as he took/взял/ a
golden watch from his pocket/карман/ and examined it. It was a very odd/странный/ watch.
It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving
around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though/хоть/, because
he put it back in his pocket/карман/ and said, "Hagrid's late. I suppose/предполагать/ it was
he who told you I'd be here, by the way?"

"Yes," said Professor McGonagall. "And I don't suppose/предполагать/ you're going to
tell me why you're here, of all places?"

"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family
he has left now."

"You don't mean -- you can't mean the people who live here?" cried
Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet/ноги/ and pointing/указательный/ at number four.
"Dumbledore -- you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't
find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son -- I saw
him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.
Harry Potter come and live here!"

"It's the best place for him," said Dumbledore firmly. "His aunt and
uncle will be able/в состоянии/ to explain/объяснять/ everything/все/ to him when he's older. I've
written them a letter."

"A letter?" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on
the wall. "Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain/объяснять/ all this in a
letter? These/эти/ people will never understand him! He'll be famous -- a
legend -- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day
in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child
in our world will know his name!"

"Exactly/в точку/," said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his
half-moon glasses. "It would be enough/достаточно/ to turn any boy's head. Famous
before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won/выиграл/'t even
remember! CarA you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away/далеко/
from all that until/до/ he's ready to take it?"

Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind/разум/, swallowed, and
then said, "Yes -- yes, you're right, of course. But how is the boy
getting here, Dumbledore?" She eyed his cloak suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ as though/хоть/ she
thought/думал/ he might be hiding Harry underneath/под/ it.

"Hagrid's bringing him."

"You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as
this?"

I would trust Hagrid with my life," said Dumbledore.

"I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place," said Professor
McGonagall grudgingly, "but you can't pretend he's not careless. He does
tend to -- what was that?"

A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew
steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a
headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and
a huge motorcycle fell/упал/ out of the air and landed/высадился/ on the road in front of
them.

If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride
it. He was almost/почти/ twice as tall as a normal man and at least/наименее/ five times
as wide/широкий/. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long
tangles of bushy black hair and beard/борода/ hid most of his face, he had hands
the size of trash can lids, and his feet/ноги/ in their leather boots were
like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms/оружие/ he was holding a bundle
of blankets.

"Hagrid," said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. "At last. And where did
you get that motorcycle?"

"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit," said the giant/гигант/, climbing
carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke/говорил/. "Young Sirius Black lent it to
me. I've got him, sir."

"No problems, were there?"

"No, sir -- house was almost/почти/ destroyed, but I got him out all right
before the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell/упал/ asleep/спящий/ as we was
flyin' over Bristol."

Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent/изогнутый/ forward over the bundle of
blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep/спящий/. Under a
tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead/лоб/ they could see a curiously
shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.

"Is that where -?" whispered/прошептал/ Professor McGonagall.

"Yes," said Dumbledore. "He'll have that scar/шрам/ forever."

"Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?"

"Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself
above/выше/ my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well
-- give him here, Hagrid -- we'd better get this over with."

Dumbledore took/взял/ Harry in his arms/оружие/ and turned/оказалось/ toward/к/ the Dursleys' house.

"Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?" asked Hagrid. He bent/изогнутый/ his
great, shaggy head over Harry and gave/дал/ him what must have been a very
scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/, Hagrid let out a howl like a
wounded dog.

"Shhh!" hissed Professor McGonagall, "you'll wake the Muggles!"

"S-s-sorry," sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted/пятнистый/ handkerchief and
burying his face in it. "But I c-c-can't stand/стоять/ it -- Lily an' James dead
-- an' poor little Harry off ter/тер/ live with Muggles -"

"Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself/сам/, Hagrid, or
we'll be found," Professor McGonagall whispered/прошептал/, patting Hagrid gingerly
on the arm/рука/ as Dumbledore stepped/ступенчатый/ over the low garden wall and walked to
the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took/взял/ a letter out
of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to
the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood/стоял/ and looked at
the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook/встряхнул/, Professor McGonagall
blinked furiously/бешено/, and the twinkling light that usually shone from
Dumbledore's eyes seemed/казалось/ to have gone out.

"Well," said Dumbledore finally, "that's that. We've no business staying
here. We may as well go and join the celebrations."

"Yeah," said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, "I'll be takin' Sirius his
bike back. G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir."

Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung/качнулся/ himself/сам/
onto/на/ the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose
into the air and off into the night.

"I shall see you soon/скоро/, I expect, Professor McGonagall," said Dumbledore,
nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose/нос/ in reply.

Dumbledore turned/оказалось/ and walked back down the street. On the corner he
stopped and took/взял/ out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and
twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet/бирючина/
Drive glowed suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking
around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the
bundle of blankets on the step of number four.

"Good luck, Harry," he murmured. He turned/оказалось/ on his heel and with a swish
of his cloak, he was gone.

A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet/бирючина/ Drive, which lay/прокладывать/ silent and
tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect
astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled/прокат/ over inside his
blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside
him and he slept on, not knowing/знание/ he was special, not knowing/знание/ he was
famous, not knowing/знание/ he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs.
Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk
bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being/являющийся/ prodded and
pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn't know that at this very
moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up
their glasses and saying in hushed voices: "To Harry Potter -- the boy
who lived!"


CHAPTER TWO

THE VANISHING GLASS

Nearly ten years had passed/прошло/ since the Dursleys had woken up to find
their nephew on the front step, but Privet/бирючина/ Drive had hardly changed at
all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass
number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept/подкрался/ into their living
room, which was almost/почти/ exactly/в точку/ the same as it had been on the night when
Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls/совы/. Only the
photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed/прошло/.
Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a
large pink beach ball wearing/носить/ different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley
Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large
blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a
computer game with his father, being/являющийся/ hugged and kissed by his mother.
The room held/Ручной/ no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.

Yet Harry Potter was still/все еще/ there, asleep/спящий/ at the moment, but not for
long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made
the first noise of the day.

"Up! Get up! Now!"

Harry woke/просыпался/ with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.

"Up!" she screeched. Harry heard/услышанным/ her walking toward/к/ the kitchen and then
the sound of the frying pan being/являющийся/ put on the stove. He rolled/прокат/ onto/на/ his
back and tried/пытался/ to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a
good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny
feeling he'd had the same dream before.

His aunt was back outside the door.

"Are you up yet?" she demanded.

"Nearly," said Harry.

"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you
dare/сметь/ let it burn, I want everything/все/ perfect on Duddy's birthday."

Harry groaned.

"What did you say?" his aunt snapped/щелкнул/ through the door.

"Nothing, nothing..."

Dudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten/забытый/? Harry got slowly out
of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and,
after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to
spiders, because the cupboard/шкаф/ under the stairs/лестница/ was full of them, and
that was where he slept.

When he was dressed he went/отправился/ down the hall into the kitchen. The table
was almost/почти/ hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as
though/хоть/ Dudley had gotten/полученный/ the new computer he wanted, not to mention the
second television and the racing bike. Exactly/в точку/ why Dudley wanted a
racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated
exercise -- unless/если/ of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's
favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch/поймать/ him. Harry
didn't look it, but he was very fast.

Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard/шкаф/, but Harry
had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and
skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes
of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry
had a thin/тонкий/ face, knobbly knees/колени/, black hair, and bright/яркий/ green eyes. He
wore round glasses held/Ручной/ together with a lot of Scotch tape because of
all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose/нос/. The only thing Harry
liked about his own appearance was a very thin/тонкий/ scar/шрам/ on his forehead/лоб/ that
was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could
remember, and the first question he could ever/Когда-либо/ remember asking his Aunt
Petunia was how he had gotten/полученный/ it.

"In the car crash when your parents died," she had said. "And don't ask
questions."

Don't ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet/тихо/ life with the
Dursleys.

Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning/превращение/ over the bacon.

"Comb your hair!" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.

About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and
shouted/кричал/ that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts
than the rest/отдых/ of the boys in his class put

together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way --
all over the place.

Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his
mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face,
not much neck/шея/, small, watery blue eyes, and thick/толстый/ blond hair that lay/прокладывать/
smoothly on his thick/толстый/, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley
looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a
pig in a wig.

Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult
as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents.
His face fell/упал/.

"Thirty-six," he said, looking up at his mother and father. "That's two
less than last year."

"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here
under this big one from Mommy and Daddy."

"All right, thirty-seven then," said Dudley, going red in the face.
Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming/приход/ on, began wolfing down
his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned/оказалось/ the table over.

Aunt Petunia obviously/очевидно/ scented danger, too, because she said quickly,
"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's
that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right''

Dudley thought/думал/ for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said
slowly, "So I'll have thirty ... thirty..."

"Thirty-nine, sweetums," said Aunt Petunia.

"Oh." Dudley sat/сидел/ down heavily and grabbed/схватил/ the nearest parcel. "All right
then."

Uncle Vernon chuckled. "Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like
his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!" He ruffled Dudley's hair.

At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went/отправился/ to answer it
while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a
video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and
a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia
came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.

"Bad news, Vernon," she said. "Mrs. Figg's broken her leg/нога/. She can't
take him." She jerked/рывком/ her head in Harry's direction.

Dudley's mouth fell/упал/ open in horror/ужастик/, but Harry's heart gave/дал/ a leap. Every
year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took/взял/ him and a friend out for the
day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every
year, Harry was left behind/за/ with Mrs. Figg, a mad/Сумасшедший/ old lady who lived two
streets away/далеко/. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage
and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever/Когда-либо/
owned.

"Now what?" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously/бешено/ at Harry as though/хоть/ he'd
planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had
broken her leg/нога/, but it wasn't easy when he reminded/напомнил/ himself/сам/ it would be
a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and
Tufty again.

"We could phone Marge," Uncle Vernon suggested.

"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy."

The Dursleys often spoke/говорил/ about Harry like this, as though/хоть/ he wasn't
there -- or rather/скорее/, as though/хоть/ he was something very nasty/противный/ that couldn't
understand them, like a slug.

"What about what's-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?"

"On vacation in Majorca," snapped/щелкнул/ Aunt Petunia.

"You could just leave me here," Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able/в состоянии/ to
watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go
on Dudley's computer).

Aunt Petunia looked as though/хоть/ she'd just swallowed a lemon.

"And come back and find the house in ruins?" she snarled.

"I won/выиграл/'t blow up the house," said Harry, but they weren't listening.

"I suppose/предполагать/ we could take him to the zoo," said Aunt Petunia slowly, "...
and leave him in the car...."

"That car's new, he's not sitting in it alone/в одиночестве/...."

Dudley began to cry loudly/громко/. In fact, he wasn't really crying -- it had
been years since he'd really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up
his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.

"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won/выиграл/'t let him spoil your special
day!" she cried, flinging her arms/оружие/ around him.

"I... don't... want... him... t-t-to come!" Dudley yelled/вопил/ between huge,
pretend sobs. "He always sp- spoils everything/все/!" He shot Harry a nasty/противный/
grin through the gap in his mother's arms/оружие/.

Just then, the doorbell rang -- "Oh, good Lord, they're here!" said Aunt
Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers/причалы/
Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers/причалы/ was a scrawny boy with a face
like a rat. He was usually the one who held/Ручной/ people's arms/оружие/ behind/за/ their
backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.

Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe/верить/ his luck, was sitting in
the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers/причалы/ and Dudley, on the way to the
zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able/в состоянии/
to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle
Vernon had taken/взятый/ Harry aside.

"I'm warning you," he had said, putting his large purple/пурпурный/ face right up
close to Harry's, "I'm warning you now, boy -- any funny business,
anything at all -- and you'll be in that cupboard/шкаф/ from now until/до/
Christmas."

"I'm not going to do anything," said Harry, "honestly..

But Uncle Vernon didn't believe/верить/ him. No one ever/Когда-либо/ did.

The problem was, strange/странный/ things often happened around Harry and it was
just no good telling/говоря/ the Dursleys he didn't make them happen.

Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming/приход/ back from the barbers looking
as though/хоть/ he hadn't been at all, had taken/взятый/ a pair of kitchen scissors
and cut his hair so short he was almost/почти/ bald except/Кроме/ for his bangs, which
she left "to hide that horrible/какой ужас/ scar/шрам/." Dudley had laughed himself/сам/ silly
at Harry, who spent/потраченный/ a sleepless night imagining school the next day,
where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.
Next morning, however, he had gotten/полученный/ up to find his hair exactly/в точку/ as it
had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week
in his cupboard/шкаф/ for this, even though/хоть/ he had tried/пытался/ to explain/объяснять/ that he
couldn't explain/объяснять/ how it had grown back so quickly.

Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting
old sweater/свитер/ of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls) -- The harder she
tried/пытался/ to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed/казалось/ to become, until/до/
finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit
Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided/приняли решение/ it must have shrunk in the wash and, to
his great relief, Harry wasn't punished.

On the other hand, he'd gotten/полученный/ into terrible trouble/беда/ for being/являющийся/ found on
the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as
usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone/кто угодно/ else's, there he was
sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter
from Harry's headmistress telling/говоря/ them Harry had been climbing school
buildings. But all he'd tried/пытался/ to do (as he shouted/кричал/ at Uncle Vernon
through the locked/запертый/ door of his cupboard/шкаф/) was jump behind/за/ the big trash
cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed/предполагаемый/ that the wind must have
caught/пойманный/ him in mid- jump.

But today, nothing was going to go wrong/неправильно/. It was even worth being/являющийся/ with
Dudley and Piers/причалы/ to be spending the day somewhere/где-то/ that wasn't school,
his cupboard/шкаф/, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room.

While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to
complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the
bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning,
it was motorcycles.

"... roaring along/вдоль/ like maniacs, the young hoodlums," he said, as a
motorcycle overtook them.

I had a dream about a motorcycle," said Harry, remembering suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/. "It
was flying."

Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned/оказалось/ right
around in his seat and yelled/вопил/ at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet
with a mustache: "MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!"

Dudley and Piers/причалы/ sniggered.

I know they don't," said Harry. "It was only a dream."

But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the
Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking
about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter/дело/ if it was in a
dream or even a cartoon -- they seemed/казалось/ to think he might get dangerous
ideas.

It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The
Dursleys bought/купил/ Dudley and Piers/причалы/ large chocolate ice creams at the
entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry
what he wanted before they could hurry/торопиться/ him away/далеко/, they bought/купил/ him a cheap
lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either/или/, Harry thought/думал/, licking it as they
watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley,
except/Кроме/ that it wasn't blond.

Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to
walk a little way apart/Кроме/ from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers/причалы/, who
were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall/падать/
back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo
restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker
glory didn't have enough/достаточно/ ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought/купил/ him
another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.

Harry felt/почувствовал/, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to
last.

After lunch they went/отправился/ to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in
there, with lit windows all along/вдоль/ the walls. Behind/за/ the glass, all sorts
of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and
stone. Dudley and Piers/причалы/ wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick/толстый/,
man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the
place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car
and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn't look in
the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep/спящий/.

Dudley stood/стоял/ with his nose/нос/ pressed against/против/ the glass, staring/уставившись/ at the
glistening brown coils.

"Make it move," he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the
glass, but the snake didn't budge.

"Do it again," Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly
with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.

"This is boring," Dudley moaned. He shuffled away/далеко/.

Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He
wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no
company except/Кроме/ stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying
to disturb it all day long. It was worse/хуже/ than having a cupboard/шкаф/ as a
bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door
to wake you up; at least/наименее/ he got to visit the rest/отдых/ of the house.

The snake suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised/поднятый/
its head until/до/ its eyes were on a level with Harry's.

It winked.

Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone/кто угодно/ was
watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.

The snake jerked/рывком/ its head toward/к/ Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised/поднятый/
its eyes to the ceiling/потолок/. It gave/дал/ Harry a look that said quite/довольно/ plainly:

"I get that all the time.

"I know," Harry murmured through the glass, though/хоть/ he wasn't sure the
snake could hear him. "It must be really annoying."

The snake nodded/кивнул/ vigorously.

"Where do you come from, anyway/так или иначе/?" Harry asked.

The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry
peered at it.

Boa Constrictor, Brazil.

"Was it nice there?"

The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on:
This specimen was bred in the zoo. "Oh, I see -- so you've never been to
Brazil?"

As the snake shook/встряхнул/ its head, a deafening shout behind/за/ Harry made both of
them jump.

"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON/выиграл/'T BELIEVE/верить/
WHAT IT'S DOING!"

Dudley came waddling toward/к/ them as fast as he could.

"Out of the way, you," he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught/пойманный/ by
surprise, Harry fell/упал/ hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened
so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers/причалы/ and Dudley were
leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt/прыгнула/ back with
howls of horror/ужастик/.

Harry sat/сидел/ up and gasped/ахнула/; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank
had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering
out onto/на/ the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed/кричал/ and
started running for the exits.

As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low,
hissing voice said, "Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo."

The keeper/хранитель/ of the reptile house was in shock.

"But the glass," he kept/держали/ saying, "where did the glass go?"

The zoo director himself/сам/ made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea
while he apologized over and over again. Piers/причалы/ and Dudley could only
gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except/Кроме/
snap playfully at their heels as it passed/прошло/, but by the time they were
all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling/говоря/ them how it had
nearly bitten off his leg/нога/, while Piers/причалы/ was swearing it had tried/пытался/ to
squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least/наименее/, was Piers/причалы/
calming down enough/достаточно/ to say, "Harry was talking to it, weren't you,
Harry?"

Uncle Vernon waited until/до/ Piers/причалы/ was safely out of the house before
starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed/удалось/ to
say, "Go -- cupboard/шкаф/ -- stay -- no meals," before he collapsed into a
chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.

Harry lay/прокладывать/ in his dark cupboard/шкаф/ much later, wishing he had a watch. He
didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were
asleep/спящий/ yet. Until/до/ they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen
for some food.

He'd lived with the Dursleys almost/почти/ ten years, ten miserable years, as
long as he could remember, ever/Когда-либо/ since he'd been a baby and his parents
had died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being/являющийся/ in the car when
his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during/в течение/ long
hours in his cupboard/шкаф/, he came up with a strange/странный/ vision: a blinding
flash of green light and a burn- ing pain/боль/ on his forehead/лоб/. This, he
supposed/предполагаемый/, was the crash, though/хоть/ he couldn't imagine where all the green
light came from. He couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and
uncle never spoke/говорил/ about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask
questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.

When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown
relation coming/приход/ to take him away/далеко/, but it had never happened; the
Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought/думал/ (or maybe hoped)
that strangers in the street seemed/казалось/ to know him. Very strange/странный/ strangers
they were, too. A tiny/крошечный/ man in a violet top hat/шапка/ had bowed to him once
while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry
furiously/бешено/ if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the
shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in
green had waved/махал/ merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long
purple/пурпурный/ coat/Пальто/ had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and
then walked away/далеко/ without a word. The weirdest thing about all these/эти/
people was the way they seemed/казалось/ to vanish the second Harry tried/пытался/ to get a
closer/ближе/ look.

At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated
that odd/странный/ Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and
nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.


CHAPTER THREE

THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE

The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his
longest-ever/Когда-либо/ punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard/шкаф/
again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his
new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time
out on his racing bike, knocked/постучался/ down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet/бирючина/
Drive on her crutches.

Harry was glad/довольный/ school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang,
who visited the house every single day. Piers/причалы/, Dennis, Malcolm, and
Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and
stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest/отдых/ of them were all quite/довольно/
happy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting.

This was why Harry spent/потраченный/ as much time as possible out of the house,
wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he
could see a tiny/крошечный/ ray of hope. When September came he would be going off
to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be
with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private
school, Smeltings. Piers/причалы/ Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the
other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley
thought/думал/ this was very funny.

"They stuff/материал/ people's heads/руководители/ down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,"
he told Harry. "Want to come upstairs/вверх по лестнице/ and practice?"

"No, thanks," said Harry. "The poor toilet's never had anything as
horrible/какой ужас/ as your head down it -- it might be sick." Then he ran, before
Dudley could work out what he'd said.

One day in July, Aunt Petunia took/взял/ Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings
uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's. Mrs. Figg wasn 't as bad as
usual. It turned/оказалось/ out she'd broken her leg/нога/ tripping over one of her cats,
and she didn't seem/казаться/ quite/довольно/ as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch
television and gave/дал/ him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though/хоть/
she'd had it for several years.

That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in
his brand-new uniform. Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange
knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried/осуществляется/
knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't
looking. This was supposed/предполагаемый/ to be good training for later life.

As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said
gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst/взрыв/
into tears and said she couldn't believe/верить/ it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he
looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn't trust himself/сам/ to speak. He
thought/думал/ two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to
laugh.

There was a horrible/какой ужас/ smell/запах/ in the kitchen the next morning when Harry
went/отправился/ in for breakfast. It seemed/казалось/ to be coming/приход/ from a large metal tub in
the sink. He went/отправился/ to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like
dirty rags swimming in gray water.

"What's this?" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always
did if he dared to ask a question.

"Your new school uniform," she said.

Harry looked in the bowl again.

"Oh," he said, "I didn't realize it had to be so wet."

"DotA be stupid," snapped/щелкнул/ Aunt Petunia. "I'm dyeing some of Dudley's old
things gray for you. It'll look just like everyone else's when I've
finished."

Harry seriously doubted this, but thought/думал/ it best not to argue. He sat/сидел/
down at the table and tried/пытался/ not to think about how he was going to look
on his first day at Stonewall High -- like he was wearing/носить/ bits of old
elephant skin, probably/вероятно/.

Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the
smell/запах/ from Harry's new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as
usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick/придерживаться/, which he carried/осуществляется/ everywhere,
on the table.

They heard/услышанным/ the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the
doormat.

"Get the mail, Dudley," said Uncle Vernon from behind/за/ his paper.

"Make Harry get it."

"Get the mail, Harry."

"Make Dudley get it."

"Poke him with your Smelting stick/придерживаться/, Dudley."

Harry dodged the Smelting stick/придерживаться/ and went/отправился/ to get the mail. Three things
lay/прокладывать/ on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was
vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a
bill, and -- a letter for Harry.

Harry picked/выбрал/ it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant/гигант/
elastic band. No one, ever/Когда-либо/, in his whole life, had written to him. Who
would? He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn't belong to the
library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet
here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:

Mr. H. Potter

The Cupboard/шкаф/ under the Stairs/лестница/

4 Privet/бирючина/ Drive

Little Whinging

Surrey

The envelope was thick/толстый/ and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the
address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.

Turning/превращение/ the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple/пурпурный/ wax
seal bearing a coat/Пальто/ of arms/оружие/; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake
surrounding a large letter H.

"Hurry/торопиться/ up, boy!" shouted/кричал/ Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. "What are you
doing, checking for letter bombs?" He chuckled at his own joke.

Harry went/отправился/ back to the kitchen, still/все еще/ staring/уставившись/ at his letter. He handed
Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat/сидел/ down, and slowly began to
open the yellow envelope.

Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over
the postcard.

"Marge's ill," he informed Aunt Petunia. "Ate a funny whelk. --."

"Dad!" said Dudley suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/. "Dad, Harry's got something!"

Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the
same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked/рывком/ sharply out of
his hand by Uncle Vernon.

"That's mine!" said Harry, trying to snatch it back.

"Who'd be writing to you?" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking/сотрясение/ the letter open
with one hand and glancing at it. His face went/отправился/ from red to green faster
than a set of traffic lights. And it didn't stop there. Within seconds
it was the grayish white of old porridge.

"P-P-Petunia!" he gasped/ахнула/.

Dudley tried/пытался/ to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held/Ручной/ it
high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took/взял/ it curiously and read the first
line. For a moment it looked as though/хоть/ she might faint. She clutched her
throat and made a choking noise.

"Vernon! Oh my goodness -- Vernon!"

They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten/забытый/ that Harry and
Dudley were still/все еще/ in the room. Dudley wasn't used to being/являющийся/ ignored. He
gave/дал/ his father a sharp/резкое/ tap on the head with his Smelting stick/придерживаться/.

"I want to read that letter," he said loudly/громко/. want to read it," said
Harry furiously/бешено/, "as it's mine."

"Get out, both of you," croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back
inside its envelope.

Harry didn't move.

I WANT MY LETTER!" he shouted/кричал/.

"Let me see it!" demanded Dudley.

"OUT!" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took/взял/ both Harry and Dudley by the
scruffs of their necks and threw/бросил/ them into the hall, slamming the
kitchen door behind/за/ them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but
silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won/выиграл/, so Harry,
his glasses dangling from one ear, lay/прокладывать/ flat on his stomach to listen at
the crack between door and floor.

"Vernon," Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, "look at the
address -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don't think
they're watching the house?"

"Watching -- spying -- might be following us," muttered/пробормотал/ Uncle Vernon
wildly.

"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don't
want --"

Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the
kitchen.

"No," he said finally. "No, we'll ignore it. If they don't get an
answer... Yes, that's best... we won/выиграл/'t do anything....

"But --"

"I'm not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn't we swear when we took/взял/
him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?"

That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd
never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard/шкаф/.

"Where's my letter?" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed
through the door. "Who's writing to me?"

"No one. it was addressed to you by mistake," said Uncle Vernon shortly.
"I have burned it."

"It was not a mistake," said Harry angrily, "it had my cupboard/шкаф/ on it."

"SILENCE!" yelled/вопил/ Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell/упал/ from the
ceiling/потолок/. He took/взял/ a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a
smile, which looked quite/довольно/ painful.

"Er/эр/ -- yes, Harry -- about this cupboard/шкаф/. Your aunt and I have been
thinking... you're really getting a bit big for it... we think it might
be nice if you moved into Dudley's second bedroom.

"Why?" said Harry.

"Don't ask questions!" snapped/щелкнул/ his uncle. "Take this stuff/материал/ upstairs/вверх по лестнице/,
now."

The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt
Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one
where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept/держали/ all the toys and things
that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom. It only took/взял/ Harry one trip
upstairs/вверх по лестнице/ to move everything/все/ he owned from the cupboard/шкаф/ to this room. He
sat/сидел/ down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything/все/ in here was
broken. The month-old video camera was lying/лежащий/ on top of a small, working
tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the
corner was Dudley's first-ever/Когда-либо/ television set, which he'd put his foot
through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large
birdcage, which had once held/Ручной/ a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school
for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent/изогнутый/
because Dudley had sat/сидел/ on it. Other shelves were full of books. They
were the only things in the room that looked as though/хоть/ they'd never been
touched.

From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don't
want him in there... I need that room... make him get out...."

Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have given
anything to be up here. Today he'd rather/скорее/ be back in his cupboard/шкаф/ with
that letter than up here without it.

Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather/скорее/ quiet/тихо/. Dudley was in
shock. He'd screamed/кричал/, whacked his father with his Smelting stick/придерживаться/, been
sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the
greenhouse roof, and he still/все еще/ didn't have his room back. Harry was
thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the
letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept/держали/ looking at each
other darkly.

When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed/казалось/ to be trying to be nice
to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard/услышанным/ him banging things with
his Smelting stick/придерживаться/ all the way down the hall. Then he shouted/кричал/, "There's
another one! 'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet/бирючина/ Drive --'"

With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt/прыгнула/ from his seat and ran down the
hall, Harry right behind/за/ him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the
ground/земля/ to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact
that Harry had grabbed/схватил/ Uncle Vernon around the neck/шея/ from behind/за/. After a
minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the
Smelting stick/придерживаться/, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath/дыхание/, with
Harry's letter clutched in his hand.

"Go to your cupboard/шкаф/ -- I mean, your bedroom," he wheezed at Harry.
"Dudley -- go -- just go."

Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone/кто то/ knew he had moved out
of his cupboard/шкаф/ and they seemed/казалось/ to know he hadn't received his first
letter. Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure
they didn't fail. He had a plan.

The repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning. Harry
turned/оказалось/ it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn't wake the
Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning/превращение/ on any of the lights.

He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet/бирючина/ Drive and
get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept/подкрался/
across/через/ the dark hall toward/к/ the front door --

Harry leapt/прыгнула/ into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on
the doormat -- something alive!

Lights clicked on upstairs/вверх по лестнице/ and to his horror/ужастик/ Harry realized that the
big, squashy something had been his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been
lying/лежащий/ at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making
sure that Harry didn't do exactly/в точку/ what he'd been trying to do. He
shouted/кричал/ at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make
a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the
time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap.
Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.

I want --" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into
pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He
stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.

"See," he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, "if
they can't deliver them they'll just give up."

"I'm not sure that'll work, Vernon."

"Oh, these/эти/ people's minds work in strange/странный/ ways, Petunia, they're not
like you and me," said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the
piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought/привел/ him.

On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they
couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door,
slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small
window in the downstairs bathroom.

Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got
out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and
back doors so no one could go out. He hummed "Tiptoe Through the Tulips"
as he worked, and jumped at small noises.

On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to
Harry found their way into the house, rolled/прокат/ up and hidden inside each
of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt
Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious
telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone/кто то/
to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.

"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?" Dudley asked Harry in
amazement.

On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat/сидел/ down at the breakfast table looking
tired and rather/скорее/ ill, but happy.

"No post on Sundays," he reminded/напомнил/ them cheerfully as he spread marmalade
on his newspapers, "no damn letters today --"

Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke/говорил/ and caught/пойманный/
him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty
letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys
ducked, but Harry leapt/прыгнула/ into the air trying to catch/поймать/ one.

"Out! OUT!"

Uncle Vernon seized/захватили/ Harry around the waist and threw/бросил/ him into the hall.
When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms/оружие/ over their
faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut/закрыть/. They could hear the letters
still/все еще/ streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.

"That does it," said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling
great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. I want you all back
here in five minutes ready to leave. We're going away/далеко/. Just pack some
clothes. No arguments!"

He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared
argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the
boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward/к/ the highway.
Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the
head for holding them up while he tried/пытался/ to pack his television, VCR, and
computer in his sports bag.

They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare/сметь/ ask where they
were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp/резкое/ turn and
drive in the opposite direction for a while. "Shake'em/Эм/ off... shake 'em/Эм/
off," he would mutter whenever he did this.

They didn't stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was
howling. He'd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he'd
missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone
so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.

Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the
outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds
and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on
the windowsill, staring/уставившись/ down at the lights of passing cars and
wondering/интересно/....

They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for
breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the
hotel came over to their table.

"'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an 'undred
of these/эти/ at the front desk."

She held/Ручной/ up a letter so they could read the green ink address:

Mr. H. Potter

Room 17

Railview Hotel

Cokeworth

Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked/постучался/ his hand out
of the way. The woman stared.

"I'll take them," said Uncle Vernon, standing/постоянный/ up quickly and following
her from the dining room.

Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?" Aunt Petunia suggested
timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem/казаться/ to hear her. Exactly/в точку/
what he was looking for, none/никто/ of them knew. He drove them into the
middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook/встряхнул/ his head, got back in
the car, and off they went/отправился/ again. The same thing happened in the middle
of a plowed field, halfway across/через/ a suspension bridge, and at the top of
a multilevel parking garage.

"Daddy's gone mad/Сумасшедший/, hasn't he?" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that
afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked/запертый/ them all inside
the car, and disappeared/исчез/.

It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley
sniveled.

"It's Monday," he told his mother. "The Great Humberto's on tonight. I
want to stay somewhere/где-то/ with a television. "

Monday. This reminded/напомнил/ Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and you
could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of
television -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of
course, his birthdays were never exactly/в точку/ fun -- last year, the Dursleys
had given him a coat/Пальто/ hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.
Still/все еще/, you weren't eleven every day.

Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying/проведение/ a long,
thin/тонкий/ package/пакет/ and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd
bought/купил/.

"Found the perfect place!" he said. "Come on! Everyone out!"

It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing/указательный/ at what
looked like a large rock/камень/ way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock/камень/ was
the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was
certain, there was no television in there.

"Storm forecast for tonight!" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his
hands together. "And this gentleman's kindly agreed/согласовано/ to lend us his
boat!"

A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing/указательный/, with a rather/скорее/
wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below
them.

"I've already got us some rations," said Uncle Vernon, "so all aboard!"

It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept/подкрался/ down their
necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed/казалось/ like
hours they reached/достиг/ the rock/камень/, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding,
led the way to the broken-down house.

The inside was horrible/какой ужас/; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind
whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was
damp and empty. There were only two rooms.

Uncle Vernon's rations turned/оказалось/ out to be a bag of chips each and four
bananas. He tried/пытался/ to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked
and shriveled up.

"Could do with some of those/те/ letters now, eh?" he said cheerfully.

He was in a very good mood. Obviously/очевидно/ he thought/думал/ nobody stood/стоял/ a chance
of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately
agreed/согласовано/, though/хоть/ the thought/думал/ didn't cheer him up at all.

As night fell/упал/, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the
high waves splattered the walls of the hut/хижина/ and a fierce wind rattled the
filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second
room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle
Vernon went/отправился/ off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find
the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest,
most ragged blanket.

The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went/отправился/ on. Harry
couldn't sleep. He shivered and turned/оказалось/ over, trying to get comfortable,
his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley's snores were drowned by the
low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of
Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat
wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time. He lay/прокладывать/ and
watched his birthday tick nearer/ближе/, wondering/интересно/ if the Dursleys would
remember at all, wondering/интересно/ where the letter writer was now.

Five minutes to go. Harry heard/услышанным/ something creak outside. He hoped the
roof wasn't going to fall/падать/ in, although/несмотря на то что/ he might be warmer if it did.
Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet/бирючина/ Drive would be so full of
letters when they got back that he'd be able/в состоянии/ to steal/украсть/ one somehow/как-то/.

Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock/камень/ like
that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was
the rock/камень/ crumbling into the sea?

One minute to go and he'd be eleven. Thirty seconds... twenty ... ten...
nine -- maybe he'd wake Dudley up, just to annoy him -- three... two...
one...

BOOM.

The whole shack shivered and Harry sat/сидел/ bolt upright, staring/уставившись/ at the
door. Someone/кто то/ was outside, knocking to come in.


CHAPTER FOUR

THE KEEPER/хранитель/ OF THE KEYS

BOOM. They knocked/постучался/ again. Dudley jerked/рывком/ awake. "Where's the cannon?" he
said stupidly.

There was a crash behind/за/ them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the
room. He was holding a rifle in his hands -- now they knew what had been
in the long, thin/тонкий/ package/пакет/ he had brought/привел/ with them.

"Who's there?" he shouted/кричал/. "I warn you -- I'm armed!"

There was a pause. Then --

SMASH!

The door was hit with such force that it swung/качнулся/ clean off its hinges and
with a deafening crash landed/высадился/ flat on the floor.

A giant/гигант/ of a man was standing/постоянный/ in the doorway. His face was almost/почти/
completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled
beard/борода/, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles
under all the hair.

The giant/гигант/ squeezed his way into the hut/хижина/, stooping so that his head just
brushed the ceiling/потолок/. He bent/изогнутый/ down, picked/выбрал/ up the door, and fitted it
easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped/упал/ a
little. He turned/оказалось/ to look at them all.

"Couldn't make us a cup o' tea, could yeh? It's not been an easy
journey..."

He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat/сидел/ frozen with fear/страх/.

"Budge up, yeh great lump," said the stranger.

Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind/за/ his mother, who was crouching,
terrified, behind/за/ Uncle Vernon.

"An' here's Harry!" said the giant/гигант/.

Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the
beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.

"Las' time I saw you, you was only a baby," said the giant/гигант/. "Yeh look a
lot like yet dad, but yeh've got yet mom's eyes."

Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.

I demand that you leave at once, sit!" he said. "You are breaking and
entering!"

"Ah, shut/закрыть/ up, Dursley, yeh great prune," said the giant/гигант/; he reached/достиг/ over
the back of the sofa, jerked/рывком/ the gun out of Uncle Vernon's hands, bent/изогнутый/
it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw/бросил/ it
into a corner of the room.

Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being/являющийся/ trodden on.

"Anyway/так или иначе/ -- Harry," said the giant/гигант/, turning/превращение/ his back on the Dursleys, "a
very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer/фер/ yeh here -- I mighta sat/сидел/ on
it at some point, but it'll taste all right."

From an inside pocket/карман/ of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly
squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a
large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in
green icing.

Harry looked up at the giant/гигант/. He meant to say thank you, but the words
got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, "Who are
you?"

The giant/гигант/ chuckled.

"True, I haven't introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper/хранитель/ of Keys and
Grounds/основания/ at Hogwarts."

He held/Ручной/ out an enormous hand and shook/встряхнул/ Harry's whole arm/рука/.

"What about that tea then, eh?" he said, rubbing his hands together.
"I'd not say no ter/тер/ summat stronger if yeh've got it, mind/разум/."

His eyes fell/упал/ on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and
he snorted. He bent/изогнутый/ down over the fireplace; they couldn't see what he
was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire
there. It filled the whole damp hut/хижина/ with flickering light and Harry felt/почувствовал/
the warmth wash over him as though/хоть/ he'd sunk into a hot bath.

The giant/гигант/ sat/сидел/ back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and
began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets/карманы/ of his coat/Пальто/: a
copper kettle, a squashy package/пакет/ of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several
chipped mugs, and a bottle/бутылка/ of some amber liquid that he took/взял/ a swig from
before starting to make tea. Soon/скоро/ the hut/хижина/ was full of the sound and
smell/запах/ of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant/гигант/ was
working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt
sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said
sharply, "Don't touch anything he gives you, Dudley."

The giant/гигант/ chuckled darkly.

"Yet great puddin' of a son don' need fattenin' anymore, Dursley, don'
worry."

He passed/прошло/ the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted
anything so wonderful, but he still/все еще/ couldn't take his eyes off the
giant/гигант/. Finally, as nobody seemed/казалось/ about to explain/объяснять/ anything, he said,
"I'm sorry, but I still/все еще/ don't really know who you are."

The giant/гигант/ took/взял/ a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his
hand.

"Call me Hagrid," he said, "everyone does. An' like I told yeh, I'm
Keeper/хранитель/ of Keys at Hogwarts -- yeh'll know all about Hogwarts, o' course.

"Er/эр/ -- no," said Harry.

Hagrid looked shocked.

"Sorry," Harry said quickly.

"Sony?" barked Hagrid, turning/превращение/ to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back
into the shadows. "It' s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren't
gettin' yer/Ер/ letters but I never thought/думал/ yeh wouldn't even know abou'
Hogwarts, fer/фер/ cryin' out loud/громкий/! Did yeh never wonder/задаваться вопросом/ where yet parents
learned it all?"

"All what?" asked Harry.

"ALL WHAT?" Hagrid thundered. "Now wait jus' one second!"

He had leapt/прыгнула/ to his feet/ноги/. In his anger he seemed/казалось/ to fill the whole hut/хижина/.
The Dursleys were cowering against/против/ the wall.

"Do you mean ter/тер/ tell me," he growled at the Dursleys, "that this boy --
this boy! -- knows nothin' abou' -- about ANYTHING?"

Harry thought/думал/ this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after
all, and his marks weren't bad.

"I know some things," he said. "I can, you know, do math and stuff/материал/." But
Hagrid simply waved/махал/ his hand and said, "About our world, I mean. Your
world. My world. Yer/Ер/ parents' world."

"What world?"

Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.

"DURSLEY!" he boomed.

Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale/бледный/, whispered/прошептал/ something that sounded
like "Mimblewimble." Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.

"But yeh must know about yet mom and dad," he said. "I mean, they're
famous. You're famous."

"What? My -- my mom and dad weren't famous, were they?"

"Yeh don' know... yeh don' know..." Hagrid ran his fingers through his
hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.

"Yeh don' know what yeh are?" he said finally.

Uncle Vernon suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ found his voice.

"Stop!" he commanded. "Stop right there, sit! I forbid you to tell the
boy anything!"

A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious
look Hagrid now gave/дал/ him; when Hagrid spoke/говорил/, his every syllable trembled
with rage.

"You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore
left fer/фер/ him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An'
you've kept/держали/ it from him all these/эти/ years?"

"Kept/держали/ what from me?" said Harry eagerly.

"STOP! I FORBID YOU!" yelled/вопил/ Uncle Vernon in panic.

Aunt Petunia gave/дал/ a gasp of horror/ужастик/.

"Ah, go boil yet heads/руководители/, both of yeh," said Hagrid. "Harry -- yet a
wizard."

There was silence inside the hut/хижина/. Only the sea and the whistling wind
could be heard/услышанным/.

"-- a what?" gasped/ахнула/ Harry.

"A wizard, o' course," said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which
groaned and sank even lower, "an' a thumpin' good'un, I'd say, once
yeh've been trained up a bit. With a mum an' dad like yours, what else
would yeh be? An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer/Ер/ letter."

Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope,
addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut/хижина/-on-the-Rock/камень/,
The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:

HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY

Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE

(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme
Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)

Dear Mr. Potter,

We are pleased/довольный/ to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all
necessary books and equipment.

Term begins on September 1. We await your owl/сова/ by no later than July 31.
Yours sincerely,

Minerva McGonagall,

Deputy Headmistress

Questions exploded inside Harry's head like fireworks and he couldn't
decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, "What does
it mean, they await my owl/сова/?"

"Gallopin' Gorgons, that reminds me," said Hagrid, clapping a hand to
his forehead/лоб/ with enough/достаточно/ force to knock over a cart/тележка/ horse, and from yet
another pocket/карман/ inside his overcoat he pulled an owl/сова/ -- a real, live,
rather/скорее/ ruffled-looking owl/сова/ -- a long quill, and a roll of parchment.
With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note/заметка/ that Harry could
read upside down:

Dear Professor Dumbledore,

Given Harry his letter.

Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.

Weather's horrible/какой ужас/. Hope you're Well.

Hagrid

Hagrid rolled/прокат/ up the note/заметка/, gave/дал/ it to the owl/сова/, which clamped it in its
beak, went/отправился/ to the door, and threw/бросил/ the owl/сова/ out into the storm. Then he
came back and sat/сидел/ down as though/хоть/ this was as normal as talking on the
telephone.

Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.

"Where was I?" said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still/все еще/
ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.

"He's not going," he said.

Hagrid grunted.

"I'd like ter/тер/ see a great Muggle like you stop him," he said.

"A what?" said Harry, interested.

"A Muggle," said Hagrid, "it's what we call nonmagic folk like thern.
An' it's your bad luck you grew up in a family o' the biggest Muggles I
ever/Когда-либо/ laid eyes on."

"We swore when we took/взял/ him in we'd put a stop to that rubbish," said
Uncle Vernon, "swore we'd stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed/в самом деле/!"

"You knew?" said Harry. "You knew I'm a -- a wizard?"

"Knew!" shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/. "Knew! Of course we knew! How
could you not be, my dratted sister being/являющийся/ what she was? Oh, she got a
letter just like that and disappeared/исчез/ off to that-that school-and came
home every vacation with her pockets/карманы/ full of frog spawn, turning/превращение/ teacups
into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was -- a freak!
But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that,
they were proud of having a witch/ведьма/ in the family!"

She stopped to draw a deep breath/дыхание/ and then went/отправился/ ranting on. It seemed/казалось/
she had been wanting to say all this for years.

"Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and
had you, and of course I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange/странный/,
just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then, if you please, she went/отправился/ and got
herself blown up and we got landed/высадился/ with you!"

Harry had gone very white. As soon/скоро/ as he found his voice he said, "Blown
up? You told me they died in a car crash!"

"CAR CRASH!" roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys
scuttled back to their corner. "How could a car crash kill Lily an'
James Potter? It's an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin' his
own story when every kid in our world knows his name!" "But why? What
happened?" Harry asked urgently.

The anger faded from Hagrid's face. He looked suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ anxious.

"I never expected/ожидаемый/ this," he said, in a low, worried voice. "I had no
idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble/беда/ gettin' hold of
yeh, how much yeh didn't know. Ah, Harry, I don' know if I'm the right
person ter/тер/ tell yeh -- but someone/кто то/ 3 s gotta -- yeh can't go off ter/тер/
Hogwarts not knowin'."

He threw/бросил/ a dirty look at the Dursleys.

"Well, it's best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh -- mind/разум/, I can't
tell yeh everythin', it's a great myst'ry, parts of it...."

He sat/сидел/ down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, "It
begins, I suppose/предполагать/, with -- with a person called -- but it's incredible
yeh don't know his name, everyone in our world knows --"

"Who? "

"Well -- I don' like sayin' the name if I can help it. No one does."

"Why not?"

"Gulpin' gargoyles, Harry, people are still/все еще/ scared/испуганный/. Blimey, this is
difficult. See, there was this wizard who went/отправился/... bad. As bad as you
could go. Worse/хуже/. Worse/хуже/ than worse/хуже/. His name was..."

Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.

"Could you write it down?" Harry suggested.

"Nah -can't spell/орфографии/ it. All right -- Voldemort. " Hagrid shuddered. "Don'
make me say it again. Anyway/так или иначе/, this -- this wizard, about twenty years
ago now, started lookin' fer/фер/ followers. Got 'em/Эм/, too -- some were
afraid, some just wanted a bit o' his power, 'cause he was gettin'
himself/сам/ power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn't know who ter/тер/ trust,
didn't dare/сметь/ get friendly with strange/странный/ wizards or witches... terrible
things happened. He was takin' over. 'Course, some stood/стоял/ up to him --
an' he killed 'em/Эм/. Horribly. One o' the only safe places left was
Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of.
Didn't dare/сметь/ try takin' the school, not jus' then, anyway/так или иначе/.

"Now, yer/Ер/ mum an' dad were as good a witch/ведьма/ an' wizard as I ever/Когда-либо/ knew.
Head boy an' girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose/предполагать/ the myst'ry is why
You-Know-Who never tried/пытался/ to get 'em/Эм/ on his side before... probably/вероятно/ knew
they were too close ter/тер/ Dumbledore ter/тер/ want anythin/хоть что/' ter/тер/ do with the
Dark Side.

"Maybe he thought/думал/ he could persuade 'em/Эм/... maybe he just wanted 'em/Эм/
outta/убираться/ the way. All anyone/кто угодно/ knows is, he turned/оказалось/ up in the village where
you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old.
He came ter/тер/ yer/Ер/ house an' -- an' --"

Hagrid suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ pulled out a very dirty, spotted/пятнистый/ handkerchief and blew
his nose/нос/ with a sound like a foghorn.

"Sorry," he said. "But it's that sad -- knew yer/Ер/ mum an' dad, an' nicer
people yeh couldn't find -- anyway/так или иначе/..."

"You-Know-Who killed 'em/Эм/. An' then -- an' this is the real myst'ry of
the thing -- he tried/пытался/ to kill you, too. Wanted ter/тер/ make a clean job of
it, I suppose/предполагать/, or maybe he just liked killin' by then. But he couldn't
do it. Never wondered/задавались вопросом/ how you got that mark on yer/Ер/ forehead/лоб/? That was no
ordinary cut. That's what yeh get when a Powerful, evil curse/проклятие/ touches
yeh -- took/взял/ care of yer/Ер/ mum an' dad an' yer/Ер/ house, even -- but it didn't
work on you, an' that's why yer/Ер/ famous, Harry. No one ever/Когда-либо/ lived after
he decided/приняли решение/ ter/тер/ kill 'em/Эм/, no one except/Кроме/ you, an' he'd killed some o' the
best witches an' wizards of the age -- the McKinnons, the Bones, the
Prewetts -- an' you was only a baby, an' you lived."

Something very painful was going on in Harry's mind/разум/. As Hagrid's story
came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more
clearly than he had ever/Когда-либо/ remembered/вспомнил/ it before -- and he remembered/вспомнил/
something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel
laugh.

Hagrid was watching him sadly.

"Took/взял/ yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore's orders. Brought/привел/
yeh ter/тер/ this lot..."

"Load of old tosh," said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost/почти/
forgotten/забытый/ that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed/казалось/ to
have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were
clenched.

"Now, you listen here, boy," he snarled, "I accept there's something
strange/странный/ about you, probably/вероятно/ nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured
-- and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no
denying it, and the world's better off without them in my opinion --
asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these/эти/ wizarding types --
just what I expected/ожидаемый/, always knew they'd come to a sticky end --"

But at that moment, Hagrid leapt/прыгнула/ from the sofa and drew a battered pink
umbrella from inside his coat/Пальто/. Pointing/указательный/ this at Uncle Vernon like a
sword, he said, "I'm warning you, Dursley -I'm warning you -- one more
word... "

In danger of being/являющийся/ speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant/гигант/,
Uncle Vernon's courage failed again; he flattened himself/сам/ against/против/ the
wall and fell/упал/ silent.

"That's better," said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on
the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.

Harry, meanwhile, still/все еще/ had questions to ask, hundreds of them.

"But what happened to Vol--, sorry -- I mean, You-Know-Who?"

"Good question, Harry. Disappeared/исчез/. Vanished. Same night he tried/пытался/ ter/тер/
kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That's the biggest myst'ry, see...
he was gettin' more an' more powerful -- why'd he go?

"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough/достаточно/
human left in him to die. Some say he's still/все еще/ out there, bidin' his
time, like, but I don' believe/верить/ it. People who was on his side came back
ter/тер/ ours. Some of 'em/Эм/ came outta/убираться/ kinda trances. Don~ reckon they
could've done if he was comin' back.

"Most of us reckon he's still/все еще/ out there somewhere/где-то/ but lost his powers.
Too weak to carry on. 'Cause somethin' about you finished him, Harry.
There was somethin' goin' on that night he hadn't counted on -- I dunno
what it was, no one does -- but somethin' about you stumped him, all
right."

Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but
Harry, instead of feeling pleased/довольный/ and proud, felt/почувствовал/ quite/довольно/ sure there had
been a horrible/какой ужас/ mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He'd
spent/потраченный/ his life being/являющийся/ clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and
Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn't they been turned/оказалось/
into warty toads every time they'd tried/пытался/ to lock him in his cupboard/шкаф/? If
he'd once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley
had always been able/в состоянии/ to kick him around like a football?

"Hagrid," he said quietly/тихо/, "I think you must have made a mistake. I
don't think I can be a wizard."

To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.

"Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared/испуганный/ or
angry?"

Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it... every odd/странный/
thing that had ever/Когда-либо/ made his aunt and uncle furious with him had
happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry... chased by Dudley's
gang, he had somehow/как-то/ found himself/сам/ out of their reach... dreading going
to school with that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed/удалось/ to make it grow
back... and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn't he got his
revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn't he set a boa
constrictor on him?

Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively
beaming at him.

"See?" said Hagrid. "Harry Potter, not a wizard -- you wait, you'll be
right famous at Hogwarts."

But Uncle Vernon wasn't going to give in without a fight.

"Haven't I told you he's not going?" he hissed. "He's going to Stonewall
High and he'll be grateful for it. I've read those/те/ letters and he needs
all sorts of rubbish -- spell/орфографии/ books and wands/палочки/ and --"

"If he wants ter/тер/ go, a great Muggle like you won/выиграл/'t stop him," growled
Hagrid. "Stop Lily an' James Potter' s son goin' ter/тер/ Hogwarts! Yer/Ер/ mad/Сумасшедший/.
His name's been down ever/Когда-либо/ since he was born. He's off ter/тер/ the finest
school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he
won/выиграл/'t know himself/сам/. He'll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer/фер/ a
change, an' he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever/Когда-либо/ had
Albus Dumbled--"

"I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!"
yelled/вопил/ Uncle Vernon.

But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized/захватили/ his umbrella and whirled
it over his head, "NEVER," he thundered, "- INSULT- ALBUS- DUMBLEDORE-
IN- FRONT- OF- ME!"

He brought/привел/ the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley
-- there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a
sharp/резкое/ squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with
his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain/боль/. When he turned/оказалось/
his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in
his trousers.

Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other
room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door
behind/за/ them.

Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard/борода/.

"Shouldn'ta lost me temper," he said ruefully, "but it didn't work
anyway/так или иначе/. Meant ter/тер/ turn him into a pig, but I suppose/предполагать/ he was so much like
a pig anyway/так или иначе/ there wasn't much left ter/тер/ do."

He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.

"Be grateful if yeh didn't mention that ter/тер/ anyone/кто угодно/ at Hogwarts," he
said. "I'm -- er/эр/ -- not supposed/предполагаемый/ ter/тер/ do magic, strictly speakin'. I was
allowed ter/тер/ do a bit ter/тер/ follow yeh an' get yer/Ер/ letters to yeh an' stuff/материал/
-- one o' the reasons I was so keen ter/тер/ take on the job

"Why aren't you supposed/предполагаемый/ to do magic?" asked Harry.

"Oh, well -- I was at Hogwarts meself but I -- er/эр/ -- got expelled/исключенный/, ter/тер/
tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped/щелкнул/ me wand/палочка/ in half an'
everything/все/. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man,
Dumbledore." "Why were you expelled/исключенный/?"

"It's gettin' late and we've got lots ter/тер/ do tomorrow," said Hagrid
loudly/громко/. "Gotta get up ter/тер/ town, get all yer/Ер/ books an' that."

He took/взял/ off his thick/толстый/ black coat/Пальто/ and threw/бросил/ it to Harry.

"You can kip under that," he said. "Don' mind/разум/ if it wriggles a bit, I
think I still/все еще/ got a couple o' dormice in one o' the pockets/карманы/."


CHAPTER FIVE

DIAGON ALLEY

Harry woke/просыпался/ early the next morning. Although/несмотря на то что/ he could tell it was
daylight, he kept/держали/ his eyes shut/закрыть/ tight.

"It was a dream, he told himself/сам/ firmly. "I dreamed a giant/гигант/ called
Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open
my eyes I'll be at home in my cupboard/шкаф/."

There was suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ a loud/громкий/ tapping noise.

And there's Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought/думал/, his heart
sinking. But he still/все еще/ didn't open his eyes. It had been such a good
dream.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

"All right," Harry mumbled, "I'm getting up."

He sat/сидел/ up and Hagrid's heavy coat/Пальто/ fell/упал/ off him. The hut/хижина/ was full of
sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself/сам/ was asleep/спящий/ on the collapsed
sofa, and there was an owl/сова/ rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper
held/Ручной/ in its beak.

Harry scrambled to his feet/ноги/, so happy he felt/почувствовал/ as though/хоть/ a large balloon
was swelling inside him. He went/отправился/ straight/Прямо/ to the window and jerked/рывком/ it
open. The owl/сова/ swooped in and dropped/упал/ the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who
didn't wake up. The owl/сова/ then fluttered onto/на/ the floor and began to
attack Hagrid's coat/Пальто/.

"Don't do that."

Harry tried/пытался/ to wave the owl/сова/ out of the way, but it snapped/щелкнул/ its beak
fiercely at him and carried/осуществляется/ on savaging the coat/Пальто/.

"Hagrid!" said Harry loudly/громко/. "There's an owl/сова/

"Pay him," Hagrid grunted into the sofa.

"What?"

"He wants payin' fer/фер/ deliverin' the paper. Look in the pockets/карманы/."
Hagrid's coat/Пальто/ seemed/казалось/ to be made of nothing but pockets/карманы/ -- bunches of
keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...
finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange/странный/-looking coins.

"Give him five Knuts," said Hagrid sleepily.

"Knuts?"

"The little bronze ones/те,/."

Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl/сова/ held/Ручной/ out his leg/нога/
so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then
he flew/полетели/ off through the open window.

Hagrid yawned loudly/громко/, sat/сидел/ up, and stretched.

"Best be Off, Harry, lots ter/тер/ do today, gotta get up ter/тер/ London an' buy
all yer/Ер/ stuff/материал/ fer/фер/ school."

Harry was turning/превращение/ over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just
thought/думал/ of something that made him feel as though/хоть/ the happy balloon
inside him had got a puncture.

"Um -- Hagrid?"

"Mm?" said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.

"I haven't got any money -- and you heard/услышанным/ Uncle Vernon last night ... he
won/выиграл/'t pay for me to go and learn magic."

"Don't worry about that," said Hagrid, standing/постоянный/ up and scratching his
head. "D'yeh think yer/Ер/ parents didn't leave yeh anything?"

"But if their house was destroyed --"

"They didn' keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer/фер/ us is
Gringotts. Wizards' bank. Have a sausage, they're not bad cold -- an' I
wouldn' say no teh a bit o' yer/Ер/ birthday cake, neither/ни/."

"Wizards have banks?"

"Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins."

Harry dropped/упал/ the bit of sausage he was holding.

"Goblins?"

"Yeah -- so yeh'd be mad/Сумасшедший/ ter/тер/ try an' rob it, I'll tell yeh that. Never
mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer/фер/
anything yeh want ter/тер/ keep safe -- 'cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter/дело/ o'
fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway/так или иначе/. Fer/фер/ Dumbledore. Hogwarts
business." Hagrid drew himself/сам/ up proudly. "He usually gets me ter/тер/ do
important stuff/материал/ fer/фер/ him. Fetchin' you gettin' things from Gringotts --
knows he can trust me, see.

"Got everythin'? Come on, then."

Harry followed/с последующим/ Hagrid out onto/на/ the rock/камень/. The sky was quite/довольно/ clear now and
the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was
still/все еще/ there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.

"How did you get here?" Harry asked, looking around for another boat.
"Flew/полетели/," said Hagrid.

"Flew/полетели/?"

"Yeah -- but we'll go back in this. Not s'pposed ter/тер/ use magic now I've
got yeh."

They settled down in the boat, Harry still/все еще/ staring/уставившись/ at Hagrid, trying to
imagine him flying.

"Seems a shame ter/тер/ row, though/хоть/," said Hagrid, giving Harry another of
his sideways looks. "If I was ter/тер/ -- er/эр/ -- speed things up a bit, would
yeh mind/разум/ not mentionin' it at Hogwarts?"

"Of course not," said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out
the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and
they sped off toward/к/ land.

"Why would you be mad/Сумасшедший/ to try and rob Gringotts?" Harry asked.

"Spells -- enchantments," said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he
spoke/говорил/. "They say there's dragons guardin' the highsecurity vaults. And
then yeh gotta find yer/Ер/ way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles under
London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh'd die of hunger tryin' ter/тер/
get out, even if yeh did manage ter/тер/ get yer/Ер/ hands on summat."

Harry sat/сидел/ and thought/думал/ about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the
Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to
be left alone/в одиночестве/ while they did this, but it was very difficult, he'd never
had so many questions in his life.

"Ministry o' Magic messin' things up as usual," Hagrid muttered/пробормотал/, turning/превращение/
the page.

"There's a Ministry of Magic?" Harry asked, before he could stop
himself/сам/.

"'Course," said Hagrid. "They wanted Dumbledore fer/фер/ Minister, 0 '
course, but he'd never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the
job. Bungler if ever/Когда-либо/ there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls/совы/
every morning, askin' fer/фер/ advice."

"But what does a Ministry of Magic do?"

"Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there's still/все еще/
witches an' wizards up an' down the country."

"Why?"

"Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their
problems. Nah, we're best left alone/в одиночестве/."

At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid
folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto/на/ the
street.

Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town
to the station. Harry couldn't blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as
tall as anyone/кто угодно/ else, he kept/держали/ pointing/указательный/ at perfectly ordinary things like
parking meters and saying loudly/громко/, "See that, Harry? Things these/эти/ Muggles
dream up, eh?"

"Hagrid," said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, "did you say
there are dragons at Gringotts?"

"Well, so they say," said Hagrid. "Crikey, I'd like a dragon."

"You'd like one?"

"Wanted one ever/Когда-либо/ since I was a kid -- here we go."

They had reached/достиг/ the station. There was a train to London in five
minutes' time. Hagrid, who didn't understand "Muggle money," as he
called it, gave/дал/ the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.

People stared more than ever/Когда-либо/ on the train. Hagrid took/взял/ up two seats and
sat/сидел/ knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.

"Still/все еще/ got yer/Ер/ letter, Harry?" he asked as he counted stitches. Harry
took/взял/ the parchment envelope out of his pocket/карман/.

"Good," said Hagrid. "There's a list there of everything/все/ yeh need."

Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn't noticed/заметил/ the night
before, and read:

"Can we buy all this in London?" Harry wondered/задавались вопросом/ aloud.

"If yeh know where to go," said Hagrid.

Harry had never been to London before. Although/несмотря на то что/ Hagrid seemed/казалось/ to know
where he was going, he was obviously/очевидно/ not used to getting there in an
ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier/барьер/ on the Underground, and
complained loudly/громко/ that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.

"I don't know how the Muggles manage without magic," he said as they
climbed/поднялся/ a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined
with shops.

Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd/толпа/ easily; all Harry had to do
was keep close behind/за/ him. They passed/прошло/ book shops and music stores,
hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it
could sell you a magic wand/палочка/. This was just an ordinary street full of
ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles
beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell/орфографии/ books and
broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had
cooked up? If Harry hadn't known that the Dursleys had no sense of
humor, he might have thought/думал/ so; yet somehow/как-то/, even though/хоть/ everything/все/
Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help
trusting him.

"This is it," said Hagrid, coming/приход/ to a halt, "the Leaky/неплотный/ Cauldron/котел/. It's a
famous place."

It was a tiny/крошечный/, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn't pointed/заостренный/ it out,
Harry wouldn't have noticed/заметил/ it was there. The people hurrying by didn't
glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the
record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky/неплотный/ Cauldron/котел/ at
all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and
Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered
him inside.

For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were
sitting in a corner, drinking tiny/крошечный/ glasses of sherry. One of them was
smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat/шапка/ was talking to the old
bartender, who was quite/довольно/ bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The
low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed/казалось/ to know
Hagrid; they waved/махал/ and smiled at him, and the bartender reached/достиг/ for a
glass, saying, "The usual, Hagrid?"

"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business," said Hagrid, clapping his great
hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees/колени/ buckle.


"Good Lord," said the bartender, peering at Harry, "is this -- can this
be --?"


The Leaky/неплотный/ Cauldron/котел/ had suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ gone completely still/все еще/ and silent.

"Bless my soul," whispered/прошептал/ the old bartender, "Harry Potter... what an
honor."

He hurried/торопливый/ out from behind/за/ the bar, rushed toward/к/ Harry and seized/захватили/ his
hand, tears in his eyes.

"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back."

Harry didn't know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old
woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out.
Hagrid was beaming.

Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry
found himself/сам/ shaking/сотрясение/ hands with everyone in the Leaky/неплотный/ Cauldron/котел/.

"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can't believe/верить/ I'm meeting you at last."

"So proud, Mr. Potter, I'm just so proud."

"Always wanted to shake your hand -- I'm all of a flutter."

"Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus
Diggle."

"I've seen you before!" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle's top hat/шапка/ fell/упал/ off
in his excitement. "You bowed to me once in a shop."

"He remembers!" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. "Did
you hear that? He remembers me!" Harry shook/встряхнул/ hands again and again --
Doris Crockford kept/держали/ coming/приход/ back for more.

A pale/бледный/ young man made his way forward, very nervously/нервно/. One of his eyes
was twitching.

"Professor Quirrell!" said Hagrid. "Harry, Professor Quirrell will be
one of your teachers at Hogwarts."

"P-P-Potter," stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand,
"c-can't t-tell you how p- pleased/довольный/ I am to meet you."

"What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?"

"D-Defense Against/против/ the D-D-Dark Arts," muttered/пробормотал/ Professor Quirrell, as
though/хоть/ he'd rather/скорее/ not think about it. "N-not that you n-need it, eh,
P-P-Potter?" He laughed nervously/нервно/. "You'll be g-getting all your
equipment, I suppose/предполагать/? I've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires,
m-myself." He looked terrified at the very thought/думал/.

But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself/сам/. It
took/взял/ almost/почти/ ten minutes to get away/далеко/ from them all. At last, Hagrid
managed/удалось/ to make himself/сам/ heard/услышанным/ over the babble.

"Must get on -- lots ter/тер/ buy. Come on, Harry."

Doris Crockford shook/встряхнул/ Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them
through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was
nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.

Hagrid grinned at Harry.

"Told yeh, didn't I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell
was tremblin' ter/тер/ meet yeh -- mind/разум/ you, he's usually tremblin'."

"Is he always that nervous?"

"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind/разум/. He was fine while he was

studyin' outta/убираться/ books but then he took/взял/ a year off ter/тер/ get some firsthand
experience.... They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there
was a nasty/противный/ bit o' trouble/беда/ with a hag -- never been the same since.
Scared/испуганный/ of the students, scared/испуганный/ of his own subject now, where's me
umbrella?"

Vampires? Hags? Harry's head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was
counting bricks in the wall above/выше/ the trash can.

"Three up... two across/через/ he muttered/пробормотал/. "Right, stand/стоять/ back, Harry."

He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.

The brick he had touched quivered -- it wriggled -- in the middle, a
small hole appeared/появился/ -- it grew wider and wider -- a second later they
were facing an archway large enough/достаточно/ even for Hagrid, an archway onto/на/ a
cobbled street that twisted and turned/оказалось/ out of sight/взгляд/.

"Welcome," said Hagrid, "to Diagon Alley."

He grinned at Harry's amazement. They stepped/ступенчатый/ through the archway. Harry
looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly
back into solid wall.

The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.
Cauldrons -- All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver -- Self-Stirring
-- Collapsible, said a sign hanging/подвешивание/ over them.

"Yeah, you'll be needin' one," said Hagrid, "but we gotta get yer/Ер/ money
first."

Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned/оказалось/ his head in every
direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything/все/ at
once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their
shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking/сотрясение/ her head as
they passed/прошло/, saying, "Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they're
mad/Сумасшедший/...."

A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl/сова/
Emporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of
about Harry's age had their noses pressed against/против/ a window with
broomsticks in it. "Look," Harry heard/услышанным/ one of them say, "the new Nimbus/нимб/
Two Thousand -- fastest ever/Когда-либо/ --" There were shops selling robes/робы/, shops
selling telescopes and strange/странный/ silver instruments Harry had never seen
before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes,
tottering piles of spell/орфографии/ books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion
bottles, globes of the moon....

"Gringotts," said Hagrid.

They had reached/достиг/ a snowy white building that towered over the other
little shops. Standing/постоянный/ beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing/носить/ a
uniform of scarlet and gold, was -

"Yeah, that's a goblin," said Hagrid quietly/тихо/ as they walked up the white
stone steps toward/к/ him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry.
He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed/заостренный/ beard/борода/ and, Harry noticed/заметил/, very
long fingers and feet/ноги/. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were
facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved
upon them:

Enter, stranger, but take heed

Of what awaits the sin of greed,

For those/те/ who take, but do not earn,

Must pay most dearly in their turn.

So if you seek beneath our floors

A treasure that was never yours,

Thief, you have been warned, beware

Of finding more than treasure there.

"Like I said, Yeh'd be mad/Сумасшедший/ ter/тер/ try an' rob it," said Hagrid.

A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a
vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high
stools behind/за/ a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing
coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses.
There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more
goblins were showing people in and out of these/эти/. Hagrid and Harry made
for the counter.

"Morning," said Hagrid to a free goblin. "We've come ter/тер/ take some money
outta/убираться/ Mr. Harry Potter's safe."

"You have his key, Sir?"

"Got it here somewhere/где-то/," said Hagrid, and he started emptying his
pockets/карманы/ onto/на/ the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits
over the goblin's book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose/нос/. Harry
watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile/свая/ of rubies as big as
glowing coals.

"Got it," said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny/крошечный/ golden key.

The goblin looked at it closely.

"That seems to be in order."

"An' I've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore," said Hagrid
importantly, throwing/бросание/ out his chest. "It's about the YouKnow-What in
vault/свод/ seven hundred and thirteen."

The goblin read the letter carefully.

"Very well," he said, handing it back to Hagrid, "I will have Someone/кто то/
take you down to both vaults. Griphook/Грипхук/!"

Griphook/Грипхук/ was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog
biscuits back inside his pockets/карманы/, he and Harry followed/с последующим/ Griphook/Грипхук/ toward/к/
one of the doors leading off the hall.

"What's the You-Know-What in vault/свод/ seven hundred and thirteen?" Harry
asked.

"Can't tell yeh that," said Hagrid mysteriously. "Very secret. Hogwarts
business. Dumbledore's trusted me. More'n my job's worth ter/тер/ tell yeh
that."

Griphook/Грипхук/ held/Ручной/ the door open for them. Harry, who had expected/ожидаемый/ more
marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with
flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little
railway tracks on the floor. Griphook/Грипхук/ whistled and a small cart/тележка/ came
hurtling up the tracks toward/к/ them. They climbed/поднялся/ in -- Hagrid with some
difficulty -- and were off.

At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry
tried/пытался/ to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left,
but it was impossible. The rattling cart/тележка/ seemed/казалось/ to know its own way,
because Griphook/Грипхук/ wasn't steering.

Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept/держали/ them
wide/широкий/ open. Once, he thought/думал/ he saw a burst/взрыв/ of fire at the end of a
passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - -
they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge
stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling/потолок/ and floor.

I never know," Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart/тележка/,
"what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?"

"Stalagmite's got an 'm' in it," said Hagrid. "An' don' ask me questions
just now, I think I'm gonna be sick."

He did look very green, and when the cart/тележка/ stopped at last beside a small
door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against/против/ the
wall to stop his knees/колени/ from trembling.

Griphook/Грипхук/ unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and
as it cleared, Harry gasped/ахнула/. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns
of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.

"All yours," smiled Hagrid.

All Harry's -- it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn't have known about
this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had
they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there
had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.

Hagrid helped Harry pile/свая/ some of it into a bag.

"The gold ones/те,/ are Galleons," he explained. "Seventeen silver Sickles to
a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough/достаточно/. Right,
that should be enough/достаточно/ fer/фер/ a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest/отдых/ safe
for yeh." He turned/оказалось/ to Griphook/Грипхук/. "Vault/свод/ seven hundred and thirteen now,
please, and can we go more slowly?"

"One speed only," said Griphook/Грипхук/.

They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became/стал/
colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went/отправился/
rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned/подался/ over the side to
try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and
pulled him back by the scruff of his neck/шея/.

Vault/свод/ seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.

"Stand/стоять/ back," said Griphook/Грипхук/ importantly. He stroked the door gently with
one of his long fingers and it simply melted away/далеко/.

"If anyone/кто угодно/ but a Gringotts goblin tried/пытался/ that, they'd be sucked through
the door and trapped in there," said Griphook/Грипхук/.

"How often do you check to see if anyone/кто угодно/'s inside?" Harry asked.

"About once every ten years," said Griphook/Грипхук/ with a rather/скорее/ nasty/противный/ grin.

Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault/свод/,
Harry was sure, and he leaned/подался/ forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous
jewels at the very least/наименее/ -- but at first he thought/думал/ it was empty. Then
he noticed/заметил/ a grubby little package/пакет/ wrapped up in brown paper lying/лежащий/ on
the floor. Hagrid picked/выбрал/ it up and tucked it deep inside his coat/Пальто/. Harry
longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.

"Come on, back in this infernal cart/тележка/, and don't talk to me on the way
back, it's best if I keep me mouth shut/закрыть/," said Hagrid.

One wild cart/тележка/ ride later they stood/стоял/ blinking in the sunlight outside
Gringotts. Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag
full of money. He didn't have to know how many Galleons there were to a
pound to know that he was holding more money than he'd had in his whole
life -- more money than even Dudley had ever/Когда-либо/ had.

"Might as well get yer/Ер/ uniform," said Hagrid, nodding toward/к/ Madam
Malkin's Robes/робы/ for All Occasions. "Listen, Harry, would yeh mind/разум/ if I
slipped/поскользнулся/ off fer/фер/ a pick-me-up in the Leaky/неплотный/ Cauldron/котел/? I hate them
Gringotts carts." He did still/все еще/ look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam
Malkin's shop alone/в одиночестве/, feeling nervous.

Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch/ведьма/ dressed all in mauve.

"Hogwarts, clear?" she said, when Harry started to speak. "Got the lot
here -- another young man being/являющийся/ fitted up just now, in fact. "

In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale/бледный/, pointed/заостренный/ face was standing/постоянный/ on
a footstool while a second witch/ведьма/ pinned up his long black robes/робы/. Madam
Malkin stood/стоял/ Harry on a stool next to him) slipped/поскользнулся/ a long robe over his
head, and began to pin it to the right length.

"Hello," said the boy, "Hogwarts, too?"

"Yes," said Harry.

"My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street
looking at wands/палочки/," said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. "Then
I'm going to drag them off to took/взял/ at racing brooms/веники/. I don't see why
first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting
me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow/как-то/."

Harry was strongly reminded/напомнил/ of Dudley.

"Have you got your own broom/метла/?" the boy went/отправился/ on.

"No," said Harry.

"Play Quidditch at all?"

"No," Harry said again, wondering/интересно/ what on earth Quidditch could be.

"I do -- Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked/выбрал/ to play for my
house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you'll be in yet?"

"No," said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.

"Well, no one really knows until/до/ they get there, do they, but I know
I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been -- imagine being/являющийся/ in
Hufflepuff/хаффлпаффец/, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?" "Mmm," said Harry, wishing
he could say something a bit more interesting.

"I say, look at that man!" said the boy suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/, nodding toward/к/ the
front window. Hagrid was standing/постоянный/ there, grinning at Harry and pointing/указательный/
at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in.

"That's Hagrid," said Harry, pleased/довольный/ to know something the boy didn't.
"He works at Hogwarts."

"Oh," said the boy, "I've heard/услышанным/ of him. He's a sort of servant, isn't
he?"

"He's the gamekeeper," said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less
every second.

"Yes, exactly/в точку/. I heard/услышанным/ he's a sort of savage -- lives in a hut/хижина/ on the
school grounds/основания/ and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic,
and ends up setting fire to his bed."

"I think he's brilliant," said Harry coldly.

"Do you?" said the boy, with a slight sneer. "Why is he with you? Where
are your parents?"

"They're dead," said Harry shortly. He didn't feel much like going into
the matter/дело/ with this boy.

"Oh, sorry," said the other,. not sounding sorry at all. "But they were
our kind, weren't they?"

"They were a witch/ведьма/ and wizard, if that's what you mean."

"I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're
just not the same, they've never been brought/привел/ up to know our ways. Some
of them have never even heard/услышанным/ of Hogwarts until/до/ they get the letter,
imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families.
What's your surname, anyway/так или иначе/?"

But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, "That's you done, my
dear," and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy,
hopped down from the footstool.

"Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose/предполагать/," said the drawling boy.

Harry was rather/скорее/ quiet/тихо/ as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought/купил/ him
(chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).

"What's up?" said Hagrid.

"Nothing," Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry
cheered up a bit when he found a bottle/бутылка/ of ink that changed color as you
wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, "Hagrid, what's Quidditch?"

"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin' how little yeh know -- not knowin'
about Quidditch!"

"Don't make me feel worse/хуже/," said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate
boy in Madam Malkin's.

"--and he said people from Muggle families shouldn't even be allowed
in."

"Yer/Ер/ not from a Muggle family. If he'd known who yeh were -- he's grown
up knowin' yer/Ер/ name if his parents are wizardin' folk. You saw what
everyone in the Leaky/неплотный/ Cauldron/котел/ was like when they saw yeh. Anyway/так или иначе/, what
does he know about it, some o' the best I ever/Когда-либо/ saw were the only ones/те,/
with magic in 'em/Эм/ in a long line 0' Muggles -- look at yer/Ер/ mum! Look
what she had fer/фер/ a sister!"

"So what is Quidditch?"

"It's our sport. Wizard sport. It's like -- like soccer in the Muggle
world -- everyone follows Quidditch -- played up in the air on
broomsticks and there's four balls -- sorta hard ter/тер/ explain/объяснять/ the rules."
"And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff/хаффлпаффец/?"

"School houses. There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff/хаффлпаффец/ are a lot o'
duffers, but --"

"I bet/делать ставку/ I'm in Hufflepuff/хаффлпаффец/" said Harry gloomily.

"Better Hufflepuff/хаффлпаффец/ than Slytherin," said Hagrid darkly. "There's not a
single witch/ведьма/ or wizard who went/отправился/ bad who wasn't in Slytherin.
You-Know-Who was one."

"Vol-, sorry - You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?"

"Years an' years ago," said Hagrid.

They bought/купил/ Harry's school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts
where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling/потолок/ with books as large as
paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in
covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with
nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have
been wild to get his hands on some of these/эти/. Hagrid almost/почти/ had to drag
Harry away/далеко/ from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and
Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs/ноги/,
Tongue- Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.

"I was trying to find out how to curse/проклятие/ Dudley."

"I'm not sayin' that's not a good idea, but yer/Ер/ not ter/тер/ use magic in the
Muggle world except/Кроме/ in very special circumstances," said Hagrid. "An'
anyway/так или иначе/, yeh couldn' work any of them curses yet, yeh'll need a lot more
study before yeh get ter/тер/ that level."

Hagrid wouldn't let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron/котел/, either/или/ ("It says
pewter on yer/Ер/ list"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing
potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited
the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough/достаточно/ to make up for its horrible/какой ужас/
smell/запах/, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff/материал/
stood/стоял/ on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright/яркий/ powders lined
the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung/висела/
from the ceiling/потолок/. While Hagrid asked the man behind/за/ the counter for a
supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself/сам/
examined silver unicorn/единорог/ horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule,
glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).

Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry's list again.

"Just yer/Ер/ wand/палочка/ left - A yeah, an' I still/все еще/ haven't got yeh a birthday
present."

Harry felt/почувствовал/ himself/сам/ go red.

"You don't have to --"

"I know I don't have to. Tell yeh what, I'll get yer/Ер/ animal. Not a toad/жаба/,
toads went/отправился/ outta/убираться/ fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at - an' I don'
like cats, they make me sneeze. I'll get yer/Ер/ an owl/сова/. All the kids want
owls/совы/, they're dead useful, carry yer/Ер/ mail an' everythin'."

Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl/сова/ Emporium, which had been
dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright/яркий/ eyes. Harry now
carried/осуществляется/ a large cage that held/Ручной/ a beautiful snowy owl/сова/, fast asleep/спящий/ with
her head under her wing. He couldn't stop stammering his thanks,
sounding just like Professor Quirrell.

"Don' mention it," said Hagrid gruffly. "Don' expect you've had a lotta
presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer/фер/
wands/палочки/, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand/палочка/."

A magic wand/палочка/... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.

The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door
read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands/палочки/ since 382 B.C. A single wand/палочка/ lay/прокладывать/
on a faded purple/пурпурный/ cushion in the dusty window.

A tinkling bell rang somewhere/где-то/ in the depths of the shop as they stepped/ступенчатый/
inside. It was a tiny/крошечный/ place, empty except/Кроме/ for a single, spindly chair
that Hagrid sat/сидел/ on to wait. Harry felt/почувствовал/ strangely as though/хоть/ he had
entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that
had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow
boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling/потолок/. For some reason, the back of
his neck/шея/ prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed/казалось/ to tingle
with some secret magic.

"Good afternoon," said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have
jumped, too, because there was a loud/громкий/ crunching noise and he got quickly
off the spindly chair.

An old man was standing/постоянный/ before them, his wide/широкий/, pale/бледный/ eyes shining like
moons through the gloom of the shop.

"Hello," said Harry awkwardly.

"Ah yes," said the man. "Yes, yes. I thought/думал/ I'd be seeing you soon/скоро/.
Harry Potter." It wasn't a question. "You have your mother's eyes. It
seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand/палочка/. Ten
and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand/палочка/ for charm
work."

Mr. Ollivander moved closer/ближе/ to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those/те/
silvery eyes were a bit creepy.

"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand/палочка/. Eleven inches.
Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I
say your father favored it -- it's really the wand/палочка/ that chooses the
wizard, of course."

Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost/почти/ nose/нос/ to
nose/нос/. Harry could see himself/сам/ reflected in those/те/ misty eyes.

"And that's where..."

Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar/шрам/ on Harry's forehead/лоб/ with a
long, white finger.

"I'm sorry to say I sold the wand/палочка/ that did it," he said softly.
"Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand/палочка/, very powerful, and in
the wrong/неправильно/ hands... well, if I'd known what that wand/палочка/ was going out into
the world to do...."

He shook/встряхнул/ his head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted/пятнистый/ Hagrid.

"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.... Oak, sixteen
inches, rather/скорее/ bendy, wasn't it?"

"It was, sir, yes," said Hagrid.

"Good wand/палочка/, that one. But I suppose/предполагать/ they snapped/щелкнул/ it in half when you got
expelled/исключенный/?" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ stern.

"Er/эр/ -- yes, they did, yes," said Hagrid, shuffling his feet/ноги/. "I've still/все еще/
got the pieces, though/хоть/," he added brightly.

"But you don't use them?" said Mr. Ollivander sharply.

"Oh, no, sit," said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed/заметил/ he gripped his pink
umbrella very tightly as he spoke/говорил/.

"Hmmm," said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. "Well, now
-- Mr. Potter. Let me see." He pulled a long tape measure with silver
markings out of his pocket/карман/. "Which is your wand/палочка/ arm/рука/?"

"Er/эр/ -- well, I'm right-handed," said Harry.

"Hold out your arm/рука/. That's it." He measured Harry from shoulder to
finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round
his head. As he measured, he said, "Every Ollivander wand/палочка/ has a core of
a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn/единорог/ hairs, phoenix
tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands/палочки/
are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite/довольно/
the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with
another wizard's wand/палочка/."

Harry suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ realized that the tape measure, which was measuring
between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was
flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.

"That will do," he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on
the floor. "Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon
heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a
wave."

Harry took/взял/ the wand/палочка/ and (feeling foolish) waved/махал/ it around a bit, but Mr.
Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost/почти/ at once.

"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite/довольно/ whippy. Try --"

Harry tried/пытался/ -- but he had hardly raised/поднятый/ the wand/палочка/ when it, too, was
snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.

"No, no -here, ebony and unicorn/единорог/ hair, eight and a half inches, springy.
Go on, go on, try it out."

Harry tried/пытался/. And tried/пытался/. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting
for. The pile/свая/ of tried/пытался/ wands/палочки/ was mounting higher and higher on the
spindly chair, but the more wands/палочки/ Mr. Ollivander pulled from the
shelves, the happier he seemed/казалось/ to become.

"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we'll find the perfect match here
somewhere/где-то/ -- I wonder/задаваться вопросом/, now - - yes, why not -- unusual combination --
holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple."

Harry took/взял/ the wand/палочка/. He felt/почувствовал/ a sudden/внезапный/ warmth in his fingers. He raised/поднятый/
the wand/палочка/ above/выше/ his head, brought/привел/ it swishing down through the dusty air
and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework,
throwing/бросание/ dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and
clapped/захлопала/ and Mr. Ollivander cried, "Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed/в самом деле/, oh, very
good. Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious... "

He put Harry's wand/палочка/ back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper,
still/все еще/ muttering, "Curious... curious..

"Sorry," said Harry, "but what's curious?"

Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale/бледный/ stare.

"I remember every wand/палочка/ I've ever/Когда-либо/ sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand/палочка/. It
so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand/палочка/, gave/дал/
another feather -- just one other. It is very curious indeed/в самом деле/ that you
should be destined for this wand/палочка/ when its brother why, its brother gave/дал/
you that scar/шрам/."

Harry swallowed.

"Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed/в самом деле/ how these/эти/ things
happen. The wand/палочка/ chooses the wizard, remember.... I think we must expect
great things from you, Mr. Potter.... After all, He-
Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things -- terrible, yes, but great."

Harry shivered. He wasn't sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid
seven gold Galleons for his wand/палочка/, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his
shop.

The late afternoon sun hung/висела/ low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made
their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through
the Leaky/неплотный/ Cauldron/котел/, now empty. Harry didn't speak at all as they walked
down the road; he didn't even notice how much people were gawking at
them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped
packages, with the snowy owl/сова/ asleep/спящий/ in its cage on Harry's lap. Up
another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized
where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.

"Got time fer/фер/ a bite to eat before yer/Ер/ train leaves," he said.

He bought/купил/ Harry a hamburger and they sat/сидел/ down on plastic seats to eat
them. Harry kept/держали/ looking around. Everything/все/ looked so strange/странный/, somehow/как-то/.

"You all right, Harry? Yer/Ер/ very quiet/тихо/," said Hagrid.

Harry wasn't sure he could explain/объяснять/. He'd just had the best birthday of
his life -- and yet -- he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the
words.

"Everyone thinks I'm special," he said at last. "All those/те/ people in the
Leaky/неплотный/ Cauldron/котел/, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander... but I don't know
anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I'm
famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for. I don't know what
happened when Vol-, sorry -- I mean, the night my parents died."

Hagrid leaned/подался/ across/через/ the table. Behind/за/ the wild beard/борода/ and eyebrows he
wore a very kind smile.

"Don' you worry, Harry. You'll learn fast enough/достаточно/. Everyone starts at the
beginning at Hogwarts, you'll be just fine. just be yerself. I know it's
hard. Yeh've been singled out, an' that's always hard. But yeh'll have a
great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still/все еще/ do, 'smatter of fact."

Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the
Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.

"Yer/Ер/ ticket fer/фер/ Hogwarts, " he said. "First o' September -- King's Cross
-- it's all on yer/Ер/ ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a
letter with yer/Ер/ owl/сова/, she'll know where to find me.... See yeh soon/скоро/,
Harry."

The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until/до/
he was out of sight/взгляд/; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose/нос/ against/против/
the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.


CHAPTER SIX

THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS

Harry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun. True, Dudley was now so
scared/испуганный/ of Harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia
and Uncle Vernon didn't shut/закрыть/ Harry in his cupboard/шкаф/, force him to do
anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn't speak to him at all.
Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though/хоть/ any chair with Harry
in it were empty. Although/несмотря на то что/ this was an improvement in many ways, it did
become a bit depressing after a while.

Harry kept/держали/ to his room, with his new owl/сова/ for company. He had decided/приняли решение/ to
call her Hedwig/Хедвиг/, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school
books were very interesting. He lay/прокладывать/ on his bed reading late into the
night, Hedwig/Хедвиг/ swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased/довольный/. It
was lucky/везучий/ that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because
Hedwig/Хедвиг/ kept/держали/ bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went/отправился/ to
sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned
to the wall, counting down to September the first.

On the last day of August he thought/думал/ he'd better speak to his aunt and
uncle about getting to King's Cross station the next day, so he went/отправился/
down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on
television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and
Dudley screamed/кричал/ and ran from the room.

"Er/эр/ -- Uncle Vernon?"

Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.

"Er/эр/ -- I need to be at King's Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hogwarts."

Uncle Vernon grunted again.

"Would it be all right if you gave/дал/ me a lift?"

Grunt. Harry supposed/предполагаемый/ that meant yes.

"Thank you."

He was about to go back upstairs/вверх по лестнице/ when Uncle Vernon actually spoke/говорил/.

"Funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train. Magic carpets all got
punctures, have they?"

Harry didn't say anything.

"Where is this school, anyway/так или иначе/?"

"I don't know," said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled
the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket/карман/.

"I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven
o'clock," he read.

His aunt and uncle stared.

"Platform what?"

"Nine and three-quarters."

"Don't talk rubbish," said Uncle Vernon. "There is no platform nine and
three-quarters."

"It's on my ticket."

"Barking," said Uncle Vernon, "howling mad/Сумасшедший/, the lot of them. You'll see.
You just wait. All right, we'll take you to King's Cross. We're going up
to London tomorrow anyway/так или иначе/, or I wouldn't bother."

"Why are you going to London?" Harry asked, trying to keep things
friendly.

"Taking Dudley to the hospital," growled Uncle Vernon. "Got to have that
ruddy tail removed before he goes/идет/ to Smeltings."

Harry woke/просыпался/ at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and
nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because
he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes/робы/ -- he'd
change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure
he had everything/все/ he needed, saw that Hedwig/Хедвиг/ was shut/закрыть/ safely in her
cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two
hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the
Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to
Harry, and they had set off.

They reached/достиг/ King's Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's
trunk onto/на/ a cart/тележка/ and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought/думал/
this was strangely kind until/до/ Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the
platforms with a nasty/противный/ grin on his face.

"Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine -- platform ten. Your platform
should be somewhere/где-то/ in the middle, but they don't seem/казаться/ to have built it
yet, do they?"

He was quite/довольно/ right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over
one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and
in the middle, nothing at all.

"Have a good term," said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He
left without another word. Harry turned/оказалось/ and saw the Dursleys drive away/далеко/.
All three of them were laughing. Harry's mouth went/отправился/ rather/скорее/ dry. What on
earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny
looks, because of Hedwig/Хедвиг/. He'd have to ask someone/кто то/.

He stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare/сметь/ mention platform nine and
three-quarters. The guard had never heard/услышанным/ of Hogwarts and when Harry
couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to
get annoyed, as though/хоть/ Harry was being/являющийся/ stupid on purpose. Getting
desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but
the guard said there wasn't one. In the end the guard strode away/далеко/,
muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic.
According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes
left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he
was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly
lift, a pocket/карман/ full of wizard money, and a large owl/сова/.

Hagrid must have forgotten/забытый/ to tell him something you had to do, like
tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He
wondered/задавались вопросом/ if he should get out his wand/палочка/ and start tapping the ticket
inspector's stand/стоять/ between platforms nine and ten.

At that moment a group of people passed/прошло/ just behind/за/ him and he caught/пойманный/ a
few words of what they were saying.

"-- packed with Muggles, of course --"

Harry swung/качнулся/ round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four
boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like
Harry's in front of him -- and they had an owl/сова/.

Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart/тележка/ after them. They stopped and so
did he, just near enough/достаточно/ to hear what they were saying.

"Now, what's the platform number?" said the boys' mother.

"Nine and three-quarters!" piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was
holding her hand, "Mom, can't I go... "

"You're not old enough/достаточно/, Ginny, now be quiet/тихо/. All right, Percy, you go
first."

What looked like the oldest boy marched toward/к/ platforms nine and ten.
Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it -- but just as
the boy reached/достиг/ the dividing barrier/барьер/ between the two platforms, a large
crowd/толпа/ of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last
backpack had cleared away/далеко/, the boy had vanished.

"Fred, you next," the plump woman said.

"I'm not Fred, I'm George," said the boy. "Honestly, woman, you call
yourself/сам/ our mother? CarA you tell I'm George?"

"Sorry, George, dear."

"Only joking, I am Fred," said the boy, and off he went/отправился/. His twin called
after him to hurry/торопиться/ up, and he must have done so, because a second later,
he had gone -- but how had he done it?

Now the third brother was walking briskly toward/к/ the barrier/барьер/ he was
almost/почти/ there -- and then, quite/довольно/ suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/, he wasn't anywhere.

There was nothing else for it.

"Excuse me," Harry said to the plump woman.

"Hello, dear," she said. "First time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too."

She pointed/заостренный/ at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin/тонкий/, and
gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet/ноги/, and a long nose/нос/.

"Yes," said Harry. "The thing is -- the thing is, I don't know how to
--"

"How to get onto/на/ the platform?" she said kindly, and Harry nodded/кивнул/.

"Not to worry," she said. "All you have to do is walk straight/Прямо/ at the
barrier/барьер/ between platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared/испуганный/
you'll crash into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a
run if you're nervous. Go on, go now before Ron."

"Er/эр/ -- okay," said Harry.

He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier/барьер/. It looked very
solid.

He started to walk toward/к/ it. People jostled him on their way to
platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash
right into that barrier/барьер/ and then he'd be in trouble/беда/ -- leaning forward
on his cart/тележка/, he broke into a heavy run -- the barrier/барьер/ was coming/приход/ nearer/ближе/
and nearer/ближе/ -- he wouldn't be able/в состоянии/ to stop -- the cart/тележка/ was out of control
-- he was a foot away/далеко/ -- he closed his eyes ready for the crash --

It didn't come... he kept/держали/ on running... he opened his eyes. A scarlet
steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign
overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven O'clock. Harry looked behind/за/ him
and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier/барьер/ had been, with the
words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.

Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads/руководители/ of the chattering crowd/толпа/,
while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs/ноги/. Owls/совы/
hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and
the scraping of heavy trunks.

The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging/подвешивание/
out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats.
Harry pushed his cart/тележка/ off down the platform in search of an empty seat.
He passed/прошло/ a round-faced boy who was saying, "Gran, I've lost my toad/жаба/
again."

"Oh, Neville," he heard/услышанным/ the old woman sigh.

A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd/толпа/.

"Give us a look, Lee, go on."

The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms/оружие/, and the people around him
shrieked and yelled/вопил/ as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg/нога/.

Harry pressed on through the crowd/толпа/ until/до/ he found an empty compartment
near the end of the train. He put Hedwig/Хедвиг/ inside first and then started
to shove and heave his trunk toward/к/ the train door. He tried/пытался/ to lift it
up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped/упал/ it
painfully on his foot.

"Want a hand?" It was one of the red-haired twins/двойняшки/ he'd followed/с последующим/ through
the barrier/барьер/.

"Yes, please," Harry panted.

"Oy, Fred! C'mere and help!"

With the twins/двойняшки/' help, Harry's trunk was at last tucked away/далеко/ in a corner
of the compartment.

"Thanks," said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.

"What's that?" said one of the twins/двойняшки/ suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/, pointing/указательный/ at Harry's
lightning scar/шрам/.

"Blimey," said the other twin. "Are you

"He is," said the first twin. "Aren't you?" he added to Harry.

"What?" said Harry.

"Harry Potter, "chorused the twins/двойняшки/.

"Oh, him," said Harry. "I mean, yes, I am."

The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt/почувствовал/ himself/сам/ turning/превращение/ red. Then, to
his relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door.

"Fred? George? Are you there?"

"Coming/приход/, Mom."

With a last look at Harry, the twins/двойняшки/ hopped off the train.

Harry sat/сидел/ down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the
red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their
mother had just taken/взятый/ out her handkerchief.

"Ron, you've got something on your nose/нос/."

The youngest boy tried/пытался/ to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed/схватил/ him and
began rubbing the end of his nose/нос/.

"Mom -- geroff" He wriggled free.

"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?" said one of the
twins/двойняшки/.

"Shut/закрыть/ up," said Ron.

"Where's Percy?" said their mother.

"He's coming/приход/ now."

The oldest boy came striding into sight/взгляд/. He had already changed into his
billowing black Hogwarts robes/робы/, and Harry noticed/заметил/ a shiny silver badge
on his chest with the letter P on it.

"Can't stay long, Mother," he said. "I'm up front, the prefects have got
two compartments to themselves/самих себя/ --"

"Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?" said one of the twins/двойняшки/, with an air of
great surprise. "You should have said something, we had no idea."

"Hang/вешать/ on, I think I remember him saying something about it," said the
other twin. "Once --"

"Or twice --"

"A minute --"

"All summer --"

"Oh, shut/закрыть/ up," said Percy the Prefect.

"How come Percy gets new robes/робы/, anyway/так или иначе/?" said one of the twins/двойняшки/.

"Because he's a prefect," said their mother fondly. "All right, dear,
well, have a good term -- send me an owl/сова/ when you get there."

She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned/оказалось/ to the twins/двойняшки/.

"Now, you two -- this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl/сова/
telling/говоря/ me you've -- you've blown up a toilet or --"

"Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet."

"Great idea though/хоть/, thanks, Mom."

"It's not funny. And look after Ron."

"Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us."

"Shut/закрыть/ up," said Ron again. He was almost/почти/ as tall as the twins/двойняшки/ already
and his nose/нос/ was still/все еще/ pink where his mother had rubbed it.

"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?"

Harry leaned/подался/ back quickly so they couldn't see him looking.

"You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who
he is?"

"Who?"

"Harry Potter!"

Harry heard/услышанным/ the little girl's voice.

"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please...."

"You've already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn't something you
goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?"

"Asked him. Saw his scar/шрам/. It's really there - like lightning."

"Poor dear - no wonder/задаваться вопросом/ he was alone/в одиночестве/, I wondered/задавались вопросом/. He was ever/Когда-либо/ so polite
when he asked how to get onto/на/ the platform."

"Never mind/разум/ that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks
like?"

Their mother suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ became/стал/ very stern.

"I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don't you dare/сметь/. As though/хоть/ he needs
reminding of that on his first day at school."

"All right, keep your hair on."

A whistle sounded.

"Hurry/торопиться/ up!" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto/на/ the
train. They leaned/подался/ out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and
their younger sister began to cry.

"Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls/совы/."

"We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat."

"George!"

"Only joking, Mom."

The train began to move. Harry saw the boys' mother waving and their
sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train
until/до/ it gathered too much speed, then she fell/упал/ back and waved/махал/.

Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the
corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt/почувствовал/ a great leap of
excitement. He didn't know what he was going to but it had to be better
than what he was leaving behind/за/.

The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy
came in.

"Anyone/кто угодно/ sitting there?" he asked, pointing/указательный/ at the seat opposite Harry.
"Everywhere else is full."

Harry shook/встряхнул/ his head and the boy sat/сидел/ down. He glanced at Harry and then
looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked. Harry saw
he still/все еще/ had a black mark on his nose/нос/.

"Hey, Ron."

The twins/двойняшки/ were back.

"Listen, we're going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordan's got a
giant/гигант/ tarantula down there."

"Right," mumbled Ron.

"Harry," said the other twin, "did we introduce ourselves? Fred and
George Weasley/Уизли/. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.

"Bye," said Harry and Ron. The twins/двойняшки/ slid the compartment door shut/закрыть/
behind/за/ them.

"Are you really Harry Potter?" Ron blurted out.

Harry nodded/кивнул/.

"Oh -well, I thought/думал/ it might be one of Fred and George's jokes," said
Ron. "And have you really got -- you know..."

He pointed/заостренный/ at Harry's forehead/лоб/.

Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar/шрам/. Ron stared.

"So that's where You-Know-Who

"Yes," said Harry, "but I can't remember it."

"Nothing?" said Ron eagerly.

"Well -- I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else."

"Wow," said Ron. He sat/сидел/ and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as
though/хоть/ he had suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out
of the window again.

"Are all your family wizards?" asked Harry, who found Ron just as
interesting as Ron found him.

"Er/эр/ -- Yes, I think so," said Ron. "I think Mom's got a second cousin
who's an accountant, but we never talk about him."

"So you must know loads of magic already."

The Weasleys/Уизли/ were clearly one of those/те/ old wizarding families the pale/бледный/
boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.

"I heard/услышанным/ you went/отправился/ to live with Muggles," said Ron. "What are they like?"

"Horrible/какой ужас/ -well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,
though/хоть/. Wish I'd had three wizard brothers."

"Five," said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. "I'm the sixth
in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I've got a lot to live up
to. Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie
was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess
around a lot, but they still/все еще/ get really good marks and everyone thinks
they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others,
but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first. You never get
anything new, either/или/, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes/робы/,
Charlie's old wand/палочка/, and Percy's old rat."

Ron reached/достиг/ inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was
asleep/спящий/.

"His name's Scabbers/Scabbers/ and he's useless, he hardly ever/Когда-либо/ wakes up. Percy
got an owl/сова/ from my dad for being/являющийся/ made a prefect, but they couldn't aff
-- I mean, I got Scabbers/Scabbers/ instead."

Ron's ears went/отправился/ pink. He seemed/казалось/ to think he'd said too much, because he
went/отправился/ back to staring/уставившись/ out of the window.

Harry didn't think there was anything wrong/неправильно/ with not being/являющийся/ able/в состоянии/ to
afford an owl/сова/. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until/до/ a
month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old
clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed/казалось/ to cheer
Ron up.

"... and until/до/ Hagrid told me, I didn't know anything about be ing a
wizard or about my parents or Voldemort"

Ron gasped/ахнула/.

"What?" said Harry.

"You said You-Know-Who's name!" said Ron, sounding both shocked and
impressed. "I'd have thought/думал/ you, of all people --"

"I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name," said Harry, I
just never knew you shouldn't. See what I mean? I've got loads to
learn.... I bet/делать ставку/," he added, voicing for the first time something that
had been worrying him a lot lately, "I bet/делать ставку/ I'm the worst in the class."

"You won/выиграл/'t be. There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and
they learn quick enough/достаточно/."

While they had been talking, the train had carried/осуществляется/ them out of London.
Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were
quiet/тихо/ for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.

Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the
corridor/коридор/ and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said,
"Anything off the cart/тележка/, dears?"

Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt/прыгнула/ to his feet/ноги/, but Ron's ears
went/отправился/ pink again and he muttered/пробормотал/ that he'd brought/привел/ sandwiches. Harry went/отправился/
out into the corridor/коридор/.

He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he
had pockets/карманы/ rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many
Mars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn't have Mars Bars. What
she did have were Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best
Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron/котел/ Cakes, Licorice
Wands/палочки/, and a number of other strange/странный/ things Harry had never seen in his
life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything/все/ and paid
the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.

Ron stared as Harry brought/привел/ it all back in to the compartment and tipped
it onto/на/ an empty seat.

"Hungry, are you?"

"Starving," said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.

Ron had taken/взятый/ out a lumpy package/пакет/ and unwrapped it. There were four
sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart/Кроме/ and said, "She always
forgets I don't like corned beef."

"Swap you for one of these/эти/," said Harry, holding up a pasty. "Go on --"

"You don't want this, it's all dry," said Ron. "She hasn't got much
time," he added quickly, "you know, with five of us."

"Go on, have a pasty," said Harry, who had never had anything to share
before or, indeed/в самом деле/, anyone/кто угодно/ to share it with. It was a nice feeling,
sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties,
cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay/прокладывать/ forgotten/забытый/).

"What are these/эти/?" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs.
"They're not really frogs, are they?" He was starting to feel that
nothing would surprise him.

"No," said Ron. "But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa."

"What?"

"Oh, of course, you wouldn't know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside
them, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards. I've got about
five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy."

Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked/выбрал/ up the card. It showed a
man's face. He wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose/нос/, and
flowing silver hair, beard/борода/, and mustache. Underneath/под/ the picture was the
name Albus Dumbledore.

"So this is Dumbledore!" said Harry.

"Don't tell me you'd never heard/услышанным/ of Dumbledore!" said Ron. "Can I have a
frog? I might get Agrippa -- thanks

Harry turned/оказалось/ over his card and read:

ALBUS DUMBLEDORE

CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS

Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is
particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in
1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his
work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel/Фламель/. Professor Dumbledore
enjoys chamber/камера/ music and tenpin bowling.

Harry turned/оказалось/ the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that
Dumbledore's face had disappeared/исчез/.

"He's gone!"

"Well, you can't expect him to hang/вешать/ around all day," said Ron. "He'll be
back. No, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of her... do you
want it? You can start collecting."

Ron's eyes strayed to the pile/свая/ of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be
unwrapped.

"Help yourself/сам/," said Harry. "But in, you know, the Muggle world, people
just stay put in photos."

"Do they? What, they don't move at all?" Ron sounded amazed. "weird!"

Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and
gave/дал/ him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than
looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep
his eyes off them. Soon/скоро/ he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but
Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin.
He finally tore his eyes away/далеко/ from the druidess Cliodna, who was
scratching her nose/нос/, to open a bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

"You want to be careful with those/те/," Ron warned Harry. "When they say
every flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all the
ordinary ones/те,/ like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then
you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-
flavored one once."

Ron picked/выбрал/ up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a
corner.

"Bleaaargh -- see? Sprouts."

They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast,
coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was
even brave enough/достаточно/ to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't
touch, which turned/оказалось/ out to be pepper.

The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat
fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green
hills.

There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced
boy Harry had passed/прошло/ on platform nine and threequarters came in. He
looked tearful.

"Sorry," he said, "but have you seen a toad/жаба/ at all?"

When they shook/встряхнул/ their heads/руководители/, he wailed, "I've lost him! He keeps getting
away/далеко/ from me!"

"He'll turn up," said Harry.

"Yes," said the boy miserably. "Well, if you see him..."

He left.

"Don't know why he's so bothered," said Ron. "If I'd brought/привел/ a toad/жаба/ I'd
lose/потерять/ it as quick as I could. Mind/разум/ you, I brought/привел/ Scabbers/Scabbers/, so I can't
talk."

The rat was still/все еще/ snoozing on Ron's lap.

"He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference," said Ron in
disgust. "I tried/пытался/ to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more
interesting, but the spell/орфографии/ didn't work. I'll show you, look..."

He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking
wand/палочка/. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the
end.

"Unicorn/единорог/ hair's nearly poking out. Anyway/так или иначе/

He had just raised/поднятый/ his 'wand/палочка/ when the compartment door slid open again.
The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was
already wearing/носить/ her new Hogwarts robes/робы/.

"Has anyone/кто угодно/ seen a toad/жаба/? Neville's lost one," she said. She had a bossy
sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather/скорее/ large front teeth.

"We've already told him we haven't seen it," said Ron, but the girl
wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand/палочка/ in his hand.

"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then."

She sat/сидел/ down. Ron looked taken/взятый/ aback.

"Er/эр/ -- all right."

He cleared his throat.

"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow."

He waved/махал/ his wand/палочка/, but nothing happened. Scabbers/Scabbers/ stayed gray and fast
asleep/спящий/.

"Are you sure that's a real spell/орфографии/?" said the girl. "Well, it's not very
good, is it? I've tried/пытался/ a few simple spells just for practice and it's
all worked for me. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever/Когда-либо/ such
a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever/Когда-либо/ so pleased/довольный/, of course, I
mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard/услышанным/ --
I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it
will be enough/достаточно/ -- I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you.

She said all this very fast.

Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he
hadn't learned all the course books by heart either/или/.

"I'm Ron Weasley/Уизли/," Ron muttered/пробормотал/.

"Harry Potter," said Harry.

"Are you really?" said Hermione. "I know all about you, of course -- I
got a few extra books. for background reading, and you're in Modern
Magical History and The Rise and Fall/падать/ of the Dark Arts and Great
Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.

"Am I?" said Harry, feeling dazed.

"Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything/все/ I could if it
was me," said Hermione. "Do either/или/ of you know what house you'll be in?
I've been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far
the best; I hear Dumbledore himself/сам/ was in it, but I suppose/предполагать/ Ravenclaw/Рейвенкло/
wouldn't be too bad.... Anyway/так или иначе/, we'd better go and look for Neville's
toad/жаба/. You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there
soon/скоро/."

And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.

"Whatever/без разницы/ house I'm in, I hope she's not in it," said Ron. He threw/бросил/ his
wand/палочка/ back into his trunk. "Stupid spell/орфографии/ -- George gave/дал/ it to me, bet/делать ставку/ he
knew it was a dud."

"What house are your brothers in?" asked Harry.

"Gryffindor," said Ron. Gloom seemed/казалось/ to be settling on him again. "Mom
and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I
don't suppose/предполагать/ Ravenclaw/Рейвенкло/ would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in
Slytherin."

"That's the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?"

"Yeah," said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.

"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers/Scabbers/' whiskers are a bit lighter,"
said Harry, trying to take Ron's mind/разум/ off houses. "So what do your
oldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway/так или иначе/?"

Harry was wondering/интересно/ what a wizard did once he'd finished school.

"Charlie's in Romania studying dragons, and Bill's in Africa doing
something for Gringotts," said Ron. "Did you hear about

Gringotts? It's been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don't suppose/предполагать/ you
get that with the Muggles -- someone/кто то/ tried/пытался/ to rob a high security
vault/свод/."

Harry stared.

"Really? What happened to them?"

"Nothing, that's why it's such big news. They haven't been caught/пойманный/. My
dad says it must've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts,
but they don't think they took/взял/ anything, that's what's odd/странный/. 'Course,
everyone gets scared/испуганный/ when something like this happens in case
You-Know-Who's behind/за/ it."

Harry turned/оказалось/ this news over in his mind/разум/. He was starting to get a
prickle of fear/страх/ every time You- Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed/предполагаемый/ this
was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more
comfortable saying "Voldemort" without worrying.

"What's your Quidditch team?" Ron asked.

"Er/эр/ -- I don't know any," Harry confessed.

"What!" Ron looked dumbfounded. "Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the
world --" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the
positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to
with his brothers and the broomstick/метловище/ he'd like to get if he had the
money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game
when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the
toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.

Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was
the pale/бледный/ boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop. He was looking at Harry with
a lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley.

"Is it true?" he said. "They're saying all down the train that Harry
Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?"

"Yes," said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were
thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing/постоянный/ on either/или/ side of the pale/бледный/
boy, they looked like bodyguards.

"Oh, this is Crabbe/Крэбб/ and this is Goyle," said the pale/бледный/ boy carelessly,
noticing where Harry was looking. "And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy."

Ron gave/дал/ a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget. Draco
Malfoy looked at him.

"Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father
told me all the Weasleys/Уизли/ have red hair, freckles, and more children than
they can afford."

He turned/оказалось/ back to Harry. "You'll soon/скоро/ find out some wizarding families
are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong/неправильно/ sort. I can help you there."

He held/Ручной/ out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it.

"I think I can tell who the wrong/неправильно/ sort are for myself, thanks," he said
coolly.

Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared/появился/ in his pale/бледный/
cheeks.

"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter," he said slowly. "Unless/если/ you're a
bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know
what was good for them, either/или/. You hang/вешать/ around with riffraff like the
Weasleys/Уизли/ and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you."

Both Harry and Ron stood/стоял/ up.

"Say that again," Ron said, his face as red as his hair.

"Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?" Malfoy sneered.

"Unless/если/ you get out now," said Harry, more bravely than he felt/почувствовал/, because
Crabbe/Крэбб/ and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.

"But we don't feet/ноги/ like leaving, do we, boys? We've eaten all our food
and you still/все еще/ seem/казаться/ to have some."

Goyle reached/достиг/ toward/к/ the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron - Ron leapt/прыгнула/
forward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a
horrible/какой ужас/ yell.

Scabbers/Scabbers/ the rat was hanging/подвешивание/ off his finger, sharp/резкое/ little teeth sunk
deep into Goyle's knuckle - Crabbe/Крэбб/ and Malfoy backed away/далеко/ as Goyle swung/качнулся/
Scabbers/Scabbers/ round and round, howling, and when Scabbets finally flew/полетели/ off
and hit the window, all three of them disappeared/исчез/ at once. Perhaps they
thought/думал/ there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd
heard/услышанным/ footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.

"What has been going on?" she said, looking at the sweets all over the
floor and Ron picking up Scabbers/Scabbers/ by his tail.

I think he's been knocked/постучался/ out," Ron said to Harry. He looked closer/ближе/ at
Scabbers/Scabbers/. "No -- I don't believe/верить/ it -- he's gone back to sleep-"

And so he had.

"You've met Malfoy before?"

Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.

"I've heard/услышанным/ of his family," said Ron darkly. "They were some of the
first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared/исчез/. Said
they'd been bewitched. My dad doesn't believe/верить/ it. He says Malfoy's
father didn't need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side." He turned/оказалось/ to
Hermione. "Can we help you with something?"

"You'd better hurry/торопиться/ up and put your robes/робы/ on, I've just been up to the
front to ask the conductor, and he says we're nearly there. You haven't
been fighting, have you? You'll be in trouble/беда/ before we even get there!"

"Scabbers/Scabbers/ has been fighting, not us," said Ron, scowling at her. "Would
you mind/разум/ leaving while we change?"

"All right -- I only came in here because people outside are behaving
very childishly, racing up and down the corridors," said Hermione in a
sniffy voice. "And you've got dirt on your nose/нос/, by the way, did you
know?"

Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was
getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple/пурпурный/
sky. The train did seem/казаться/ to be slowing down.

He and Ron took/взял/ off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes/робы/.
Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath/под/
them.

A voice echoed through the train: "We will be reaching Hogwarts in five
minutes' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken/взятый/
to the school separately."

Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale/бледный/ under
his freckles. They crammed their pockets/карманы/ with the last of the sweets and
joined/присоединился/ the crowd/толпа/ thronging the corridor/коридор/.

The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way
toward/к/ the door and out on to a tiny/крошечный/, dark platform. Harry shivered in
the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads/руководители/ of the
students, and Harry heard/услышанным/ a familiar voice: "Firs' years! Firs' years
over here! All right there, Harry?"

Hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads/руководители/.

"C'mon, follow me -- any more firs' years? Mind/разум/ yer/Ер/ step, now! Firs'
years follow me!"

Slipping and stumbling, they followed/с последующим/ Hagrid down what seemed/казалось/ to be a
steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either/или/ side of them that Harry
thought/думал/ there must be thick/толстый/ trees there. Nobody spoke/говорил/ much. Neville, the
boy who kept/держали/ losing his toad/жаба/, sniffed once or twice.

"Ye' all get yer/Ер/ firs' sight/взгляд/ o' Hogwarts in a sec," Hagrid called over
his shoulder, "jus' round this bend here."

There was a loud/громкий/ "Oooooh!"

The narrow path had opened suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ onto/на/ the edge of a great black take.
Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in
the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.

"No more'n four to a boat!" Hagrid called, pointing/указательный/ to a fleet of little
boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed/с последующим/
into their boat by Neville and Hermione. "Everyone in?" shouted/кричал/ Hagrid,
who had a boat to himself/сам/. "Right then -- FORWARD!"

And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across/через/ the
lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring/уставившись/ up at
the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer/ближе/
and nearer/ближе/ to the cliff on which it stood/стоял/.

"Heads/руководители/ down!" yelled/вопил/ Hagrid as the first boats reached/достиг/ the cliff; they
all bent/изогнутый/ their heads/руководители/ and the little boats carried/осуществляется/ them through a curtain
of ivy that hid a wide/широкий/ opening in the cliff face. They were carried/осуществляется/
along/вдоль/ a dark tunnel, which seemed/казалось/ to be taking them right underneath/под/ the
castle, until/до/ they reached/достиг/ a kind of underground harbor, where they
clambered out onto/на/ rocks and pebbles.

"Oy, you there! Is this your toad/жаба/?" said Hagrid, who was checking the
boats as people climbed/поднялся/ out of them.

"Trevor!" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they
clambered up a passageway in the rock/камень/ after Hagrid's lamp, coming/приход/ out at
last onto/на/ smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.

They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, Oak
front door.

"Everyone here? You there, still/все еще/ got yer/Ер/ toad/жаба/?"

Hagrid raised/поднятый/ a gigantic fist and knocked/постучался/ three times on the castle
door.


CHAPTER SEVEN

THE SORTING HAT/шапка/

The door swung/качнулся/ open at once. A tall, black-haired witch/ведьма/ in emerald-green
robes/робы/ stood/стоял/ there. She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought/думал/
was that this was not someone/кто то/ to cross.

"The firs' years, Professor McGonagall," said Hagrid.

"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here."

She pulled the door wide/широкий/. The entrance hall was so big you could have
fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it. The stone walls were lit
with flaming torches like the ones/те,/ at Gringotts, the ceiling/потолок/ was too
high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase/лестница/ facing them led to
the upper floors.

They followed/с последующим/ Professor McGonagall across/через/ the flagged stone floor. Harry
could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right
-the rest/отдых/ of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall
showed the first years into a small, empty chamber/камера/ off the hall. They
crowded in, standing/постоянный/ rather/скорее/ closer/ближе/ together than they would usually have
done, peering about nervously/нервно/.

"Welcome to Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. "The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great
Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very
important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be
something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with
the rest/отдых/ of your house, sleep in your house dormitory/общежитие/, and spend free
time in your house common room.

"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff/хаффлпаффец/, Ravenclaw/Рейвенкло/, and
Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your
triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose/потерять/
house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is
awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a
credit to whichever house becomes yours.

"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the
rest/отдых/ of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as
you can while you are waiting."

Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose/нос/. Harry nervously/нервно/ tried/пытался/ to
flatten his hair.

"I shall return when we are ready for you," said Professor McGonagall.
"Please wait quietly/тихо/."

She left the chamber/камера/. Harry swallowed.

"How exactly/в точку/ do they sort us into houses?" he asked Ron.

"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he
was joking."

Harry's heart gave/дал/ a horrible/какой ужас/ jolt. A test? In front of the whole
school? But he didn't know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have
to do? He hadn't expected/ожидаемый/ something like this the moment they arrived.
He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified,
too. No one was talking much except/Кроме/ Hermione Granger, who was whispering
very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering/интересно/ which one
she'd need. Harry tried/пытался/ hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more
nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to
the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow/как-то/ turned/оказалось/ his teacher's wig blue. He
kept/держали/ his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall
would come back and lead him to his doom.

Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air --
several people behind/за/ him screamed/кричал/.

"What the --?"

He gasped/ахнула/. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just
streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent,
they glided across/через/ the room talking to one another and hardly glancing
at the first years. They seemed/казалось/ to be arguing. What looked like a fat
little monk was saying: "Forgive and forget/забывать/, I say, we ought to give him
a second chance --"

"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He
gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost/призрак/ -- I
say, what are you all doing here?"

A ghost/призрак/ wearing/носить/ a ruff and tights had suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ noticed/заметил/ the first years.

Nobody answered.

"New students!" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. "About to be
Sorted, I suppose/предполагать/?"

A few people nodded/кивнул/ mutely.

"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff/хаффлпаффец/!" said the Friar. "My old house, you
know."

"Move along/вдоль/ now," said a sharp/резкое/ voice. "The Sorting Ceremony's about to
start."

Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away/далеко/
through the opposite wall.

"Now, form a line," Professor McGonagall told the first years, "and
follow me."

Feeling oddly as though/хоть/ his legs/ноги/ had turned/оказалось/ to lead, Harry got into line
behind/за/ a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind/за/ him, and they walked out
of the chamber/камера/, back across/через/ the hall, and through a pair of double doors
into the Great Hall.

Harry had never even imagined such a strange/странный/ and splendid place. It was
lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair
over four long tables, where the rest/отдых/ of the students were sitting.
These/эти/ tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the
top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.
Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a
halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind/за/ them.
The hundreds of faces staring/уставившись/ at them looked like pale/бледный/ lanterns in the
flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the
ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring/уставившись/ eyes, Harry
looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling/потолок/ dotted with stars. He
heard/услышанным/

Hermione whisper, "Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read
about it in Hogwarts, A History."

It was hard to believe/верить/ there was a ceiling/потолок/ there at all, and that the
Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens.

Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed
a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she
put a pointed/заостренный/ wizard's hat/шапка/. This hat/шапка/ was patched and frayed and
extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house.

Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought/думал/ wildly,
that seemed/казалось/ the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was
now staring/уставившись/ at the hat/шапка/, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there
was complete silence. Then the hat/шапка/ twitched. A rip near the brim opened
wide/широкий/ like a mouth -- and the hat/шапка/ began to sing:

"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,

But don't judge on what you see,

I'll eat myself if you can find

A smarter hat/шапка/ than me.

You can keep your bowlers black,

Your top hats sleek and tall,

For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat/шапка/

And I can cap them all.

There's nothing hidden in your head

The Sorting Hat/шапка/ can't see,

So try me on and I will tell you

Where you ought to be.

You might belong in Gryffindor,

Where dwell the brave at heart,

Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart/Кроме/;

You might belong in Hufflepuff/хаффлпаффец/,

Where they are just and loyal,

Those/те/ patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil;

Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw/Рейвенкло/,

if you've a ready mind/разум/,

Where those/те/ of wit and learning,

Will always find their kind;

Or perhaps in Slytherin

You'll make your real friends,

Those/те/ cunning folk use any means

To achieve their ends.

So put me on! Don't be afraid!

And don't get in a flap!

You're in safe hands (though/хоть/ I have none/никто/)

For I'm a Thinking Cap!"

The whole hall burst/взрыв/ into applause as the hat/шапка/ finished its song. It
bowed to each of the four tables and then became/стал/ quite/довольно/ still/все еще/ again.

"So we've just got to try on the hat/шапка/!" Ron whispered/прошептал/ to Harry. "I'll
kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll."

Harry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat/шапка/ was a lot better than
having to do a spell/орфографии/, but he did wish they could have tried/пытался/ it on
without everyone watching. The hat/шапка/ seemed/казалось/ to be asking rather/скорее/ alot;
Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If
only the hat/шапка/ had mentioned a house for people who felt/почувствовал/ a bit queasy,
that would have been the one for him.

Professor McGonagall now stepped/ступенчатый/ forward holding a long roll of
parchment.

"When I call your name, you will put on the hat/шапка/ and sit on the stool to
be sorted," she said. "Abbott, Hannah!"

A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the
hat/шапка/, which fell/упал/ right down over her eyes, and sat/сидел/ down. A moments pause
--

"HUFFLEPUFF/хаффлпаффец/!" shouted/кричал/ the hat/шапка/.

The table on the right cheered and clapped/захлопала/ as Hannah went/отправился/ to sit down at
the Hufflepuff/хаффлпаффец/ table. Harry saw the ghost/призрак/ of the Fat Friar waving
merrily at her.

"Bones, Susan!"

"HUFFLEPUFF/хаффлпаффец/!" shouted/кричал/ the hat/шапка/ again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next
to Hannah.

"Boot, Terry!"

"RAVENCLAW/Рейвенкло/!"

The table second from the left clapped/захлопала/ this time; several Ravenclaws
stood/стоял/ up to shake hands with Terry as he joined/присоединился/ them.

" Brocklehurst, Mandy" went/отправился/ to Ravenclaw/Рейвенкло/ too, but "Brown, Lavender"
became/стал/ the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded
with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling.

"Bulstrode, Millicent" then became/стал/ a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry's
imagination, after all he'd heard/услышанным/ about Slytherin, but he thought/думал/ they
looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick
now. He remembered/вспомнил/ being/являющийся/ picked/выбрал/ for teams during/в течение/ gym at his old school.
He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but
because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.

"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!"

"HUFFLEPUFF/хаффлпаффец/!"

Sometimes, Harry noticed/заметил/, the hat/шапка/ shouted/кричал/ out the house at once, but at
others it took/взял/ a little while to decide. "Finnigan, Seamus/Симус/," the
sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat/сидел/ on the stool for almost/почти/
a whole minute before the hat/шапка/ declared him a Gryffindor.

"Granger, Hermione!"

Hermione almost/почти/ ran to the stool and jammed the hat/шапка/ eagerly on her head.

"GRYFFINDOR!" shouted/кричал/ the hat/шапка/. Ron groaned.

A horrible/какой ужас/ thought/думал/ struck Harry, as horrible/какой ужас/ thoughts always do when
you're very nervous. What if he wasn't chosen at all? What if he just
sat/сидел/ there with the hat/шапка/ over his eyes for ages, until/до/ Professor
McGonagall jerked/рывком/ it off his head and said there had obviously/очевидно/ been a
mistake and he'd better get back on the train?

When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept/держали/ losing his toad/жаба/, was called,
he fell/упал/ over on his way to the stool. The hat/шапка/ took/взял/ a long time to decide
with Neville. When it finally shouted/кричал/, "GRYFFINDOR," Neville ran off
still/все еще/ wearing/носить/ it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it
to "MacDougal, Morag."

Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at
once: the hat/шапка/ had barely touched his head when it screamed/кричал/, "SLYTHERIN!"

Malfoy went/отправился/ to join his friends Crabbe/Крэбб/ and Goyle, looking pleased/довольный/ with
himself/сам/.

There weren't many people left now. "Moon" "Nott" "Parkinson" then a
pair of twin girls, "Patil" and "Patil" then "Perks, Sally-Anne" and
then, at last -- "Potter, Harry!"

As Harry stepped/ступенчатый/ forward, whispers suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ broke out like little
hissing fires all over the hall.

"Potter, did she say?"

The Harry Potter?"

The last thing Harry saw before the hat/шапка/ dropped/упал/ over his eyes was the
hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he
was looking at the black inside of the hat/шапка/. He waited.

Hmm," said a small voice in his ear. "Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty
of courage, I see. Not a bad mind/разум/ either/или/. There's talent, A my goodness,
yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself/сам/, now that's interesting....
So where shall I put you?"

Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought/думал/, Not Slytherin, not
Slytherin.

"Not Slytherin, eh?" said the small voice. "Are you sure? You could be
great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you
on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you're sure
-- better be GRYFFINDOR!"

Harry heard/услышанным/ the hat/шапка/ shout the last word to the whole hall. He took/взял/ off
the hat/шапка/ and walked shakily toward/к/ the Gryffindor table. He was so
relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed/заметил/
that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and
shook/встряхнул/ his hand vigorously, while the Weasley/Уизли/ twins/двойняшки/ yelled/вопил/, "We got
Potter! We got Potter!" Harry sat/сидел/ down opposite the ghost/призрак/ in the ruff
he'd seen earlier. The ghost/призрак/ patted his arm/рука/, giving Harry the sudden/внезапный/,
horrible/какой ужас/ feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.

He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat/сидел/
Hagrid, who caught/пойманный/ his eye and gave/дал/ him the thumbs up. Harry grinned
back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair,
sat/сидел/ Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd
gotten/полученный/ out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair
was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the
ghosts. Harry spotted/пятнистый/ Professor Quirtell, too, the nervous young man
from the Leaky/неплотный/ Cauldron/котел/. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple/пурпурный/
turban.

And now there were only three people left to be sorted. "Thomas, Dean,"
a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined/присоединился/ Harry at the Gryffindor table.
"Turpin, Lisa," became/стал/ a Ravenclaw/Рейвенкло/ and then it was Ron's turn. He was
pale/бледный/ green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a
second later the hat/шапка/ had shouted/кричал/, "GRYFFINDOR!"

Harry clapped/захлопала/ loudly/громко/ with the rest/отдых/ as Ron collapsed into the chair next
to him.

"Well done, Ron, excellent," said Percy Weasley/Уизли/ Pompously across/через/ Harry
as "Zabini, Blaise," was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled/прокат/
up her scroll and took/взял/ the Sorting Hat/шапка/ away/далеко/.

Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how
hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed/казалось/ ages ago.

Albus Dumbledore had gotten/полученный/ to his feet/ноги/. He was beaming at the students,
his arms/оружие/ opened wide/широкий/, as if nothing could have pleased/довольный/ him more than to
see them all there.

"Welcome," he said. "Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin
our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit!
Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!

"Thank you!"

He sat/сидел/ back down. Everybody clapped/захлопала/ and cheered. Harry didn't know
whether to laugh or not.

"Is he -- a bit mad/Сумасшедший/?" he asked Percy uncertainly.

"Mad/Сумасшедший/?" said Percy airily. "He's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But
he is a bit mad/Сумасшедший/, yes. Potatoes, Harry?"

Harry's mouth fell/упал/ open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with
food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table:
roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon
and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding,
peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange/странный/ reason, peppermint
humbugs.

The Dursleys had never exactly/в точку/ starved Harry, but he'd never been
allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken/взятый/ anything
that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his
plate with a bit of everything/все/ except/Кроме/ the peppermints and began to eat.
It was all delicious.

"That does look good," said the ghost/призрак/ in the ruff sadly, watching Harry
cut up his steak,

"Can't you --?"

I haven't eaten for nearly four hundred years," said the ghost/призрак/. "I don't
need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don't think I've in troduced
myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost/призрак/
of Gryffindor Tower."

"I know who you are!" said Ron suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/. "My brothers told me about you
-- you're Nearly Headless Nick!"

"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy --" the ghost/призрак/ began
stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus/Симус/ Finnigan interrupted.

"Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?"

Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't
going at all the way he wanted.

"Like this," he said irritably. He seized/захватили/ his left ear and pulled. His
whole head swung/качнулся/ off his neck/шея/ and fell/упал/ onto/на/ his shoulder as if it was on
a hinge. Someone/кто то/ had obviously/очевидно/ tried/пытался/ to behead him, but not done it
properly. Looking pleased/довольный/ at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly
Headless Nick flipped his head back onto/на/ his neck/шея/, coughed, and said,
"So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house
championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without
winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody
Baron's becoming almost/почти/ unbearable -- he's the Slytherin ghost/призрак/."

Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible/какой ужас/ ghost/призрак/
sitting there, with blank staring/уставившись/ eyes, a gaunt face, and robes/робы/ stained
with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased/довольный/ to
see, didn't look too pleased/довольный/ with the seating arrangements.

"How did he get covered in blood?" asked Seamus/Симус/ with great interest.

"I've never asked," said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.

When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food
faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment
later the desserts appeared/появился/. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you
could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam
doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding -- "

As Harry helped himself/сам/ to a treacle tart, the talk turned/оказалось/ to their
families.

"I'm half-and-half," said Seamus/Симус/. "Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell
him she was a witch/ведьма/ 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty/противный/ shock
for him."

The others laughed.

"What about you, Neville?" said Ron.

"Well, my gran brought/привел/ me up and she's a witch/ведьма/," said Neville, "but the
family thought/думал/ I was all- Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept/держали/
trying to catch/поймать/ me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he
pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but
nothing happened until/до/ I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for
dinner, and he was hanging/подвешивание/ me out of an upstairs/вверх по лестнице/ window by the ankles
when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let
go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They
were all really pleased/довольный/, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you
should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought/думал/ I might
not be magic enough/достаточно/ to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased/довольный/
he bought/купил/ me my toad/жаба/."

On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley/Уизли/ and Hermione were talking about
lessons ("I do hope they start right away/далеко/, there's so much to learn, I'm
particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning/превращение/ something
into something else, of course, it's supposed/предполагаемый/ to be very difficult-";
"You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of
thing -- ").

Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at

the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet.
Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor
Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy
black hair, a hooked nose/нос/, and sallow skin.

It happened very suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's
turban straight/Прямо/ into Harry's eyes -- and a sharp/резкое/, hot pain/боль/ shot across/через/
the scar/шрам/ on Harry's forehead/лоб/.

"Ouch!" Harry clapped/захлопала/ a hand to his head.

"What is it?" asked Percy.

"N-nothing."

The pain/боль/ had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the
feeling Harry had gotten/полученный/ from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he
didn't like Harry at all.

"Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?" he asked Percy.

"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder/задаваться вопросом/ he's looking so
nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions/зелий/, but he doesn't want
to -- everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about
the Dark Arts, Snape."

Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again.

At last, the desserts too disappeared/исчез/, and Professor Dumbledore got to
his feet/ноги/ again. The hall fell/упал/ silent.

"Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I
have a few start-of-term notices to give you.

"First years should note/заметка/ that the forest on the grounds/основания/ is forbidden to
all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember
that as well."

Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley/Уизли/
twins/двойняшки/.

"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch/стащить/, the caretaker, to remind you all
that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.

"Quidditch trials will be held/Ручной/ in the second week of the term. Anyone/кто угодно/
interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch/самогон/.

"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor/коридор/
on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to
die a very painful death."

Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.

"He's not serious?" he muttered/пробормотал/ to Percy.

"Must be," said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. "It's odd/странный/, because he
usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere/где-то/ -- the
forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he
might have told us prefects, at least/наименее/."

"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!" cried
Dumbledore. Harry noticed/заметил/ that the other teachers' smiles had become
rather/скорее/ fixed.

Dumbledore gave/дал/ his wand/палочка/ a little flick, as if he was trying to get a
fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew/полетели/ out of it, which rose
high above/выше/ the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.

"Everyone pick their favorite tune," said Dumbledore, "and off we go!"
And the school bellowed:

"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,

Teach us something please,

Whether we be old and bald

Or young with scabby knees/колени/,

Our heads/руководители/ could do with filling

With some interesting stuff/материал/,

For now they're bare and full of air,

Dead flies and bits of fluff,

So teach us things worth knowing/знание/,

Bring back what we've forgot,

just do your best, we'll do the rest/отдых/,

And learn until/до/ our brains all rot.

Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the
Weasley/Уизли/ twins/двойняшки/ were left singing along/вдоль/ to a very slow funeral march.
Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand/палочка/ and when they
had finished, he was one of those/те/ who clapped/захлопала/ loudest.

"Ah, music," he said, wiping his eyes. "A magic beyond all we do here!
And now, bedtime. Off you trot!"

The Gryffindor first years followed/с последующим/ Percy through the chattering crowds,
out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase/лестница/. Harry's legs/ноги/ were
like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He
was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits
along/вдоль/ the corridors whispered/прошептал/ and pointed/заостренный/ as they passed/прошло/, or that twice
Percy led them through doorways hidden behind/за/ sliding panels and hanging/подвешивание/
tapestries. They climbed/поднялся/ more staircases, yawning and dragging their
feet/ноги/, and Harry was just wondering/интересно/ how much farther they had to go when
they came to a sudden/внезапный/ halt.

A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead/впереди/ of them, and as
Percy took/взял/ a step toward/к/ them they started throwing/бросание/ themselves/самих себя/ at him.

"Peeves," Percy whispered/прошептал/ to the first years. "A poltergeist." He raised/поднятый/
his voice, "Peeves -- show yourself/сам/"

A loud/громкий/, rude sound, like the air being/являющийся/ let out of a balloon, answered.

"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?"

There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide/широкий/
mouth appeared/появился/, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking
sticks.

"Oooooooh!" he said, with an evil cackle. "Ickle Firsties! What fun!"

He swooped suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ at them. They all ducked.

"Go away/далеко/, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!" barked
Percy.

Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on
Neville's head. They heard/услышанным/ him zooming away/далеко/, rattling coats of armor as
he passed/прошло/.

"You want to watch out for Peeves," said Percy, as they set off again.
"The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won/выиграл/'t even
listen to us prefects. Here we are."

At the very end of the corridor/коридор/ hung/висела/ a portrait of a very fat woman in a
pink silk dress.

"Password?" she said. "Caput Draconis," said Percy, and the portrait
swung/качнулся/ forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled
through it -- Neville needed a leg/нога/ up -- and found themselves/самих себя/ in the
Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.

Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory/общежитие/ and the
boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase/лестница/ -- they were
obviously/очевидно/ in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last: five
four-posters hung/висела/ with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had
already been brought/привел/ up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their
pajamas and fell/упал/ into bed.

" Great food, isn't it?" Ron muttered/пробормотал/ to Harry through the hangings.
"Get off, Scabbers/Scabbers/! He's chewing my sheets."

Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he
fell/упал/ asleep/спящий/ almost/почти/ at once.

Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange/странный/
dream. He was wearing/носить/ Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept/держали/ talking to
him, telling/говоря/ him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was
his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it
got heavier and heavier; he tried/пытался/ to pull it off but it tightened
painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with
it -then Malfoy turned/оказалось/ into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh
became/стал/ high and cold -- there was a burst/взрыв/ of green light and Harry woke/просыпался/,
sweating and shaking/сотрясение/.

He rolled/прокат/ over and fell/упал/ asleep/спящий/ again, and when he woke/просыпался/ next day, he
didn't remember the dream at all.


CHAPTER EIGHT

THE POTIONS/зелий/ MASTER

There, look."

"Where?"

"Next to the tall kid with the red hair."

"Wearing/носить/ the glasses?"

"Did you see his face?"

"Did you see his scar/шрам/?"

Whispers followed/с последующим/ Harry from the moment he left his dormitory/общежитие/ the next
day. People lining up outside classrooms stood/стоял/ on tiptoe to get a look
at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring/уставившись/.
Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on
finding his way to classes.

There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide/широкий/,
sweeping ones/те,/; narrow, rickety ones/те,/; some that led somewhere/где-то/ different
on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to
remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless/если/ you
asked politely, or tickled them in exactly/в точку/ the right place, and doors
that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It
was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed/казалось/
to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept/держали/ going to visit
each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.

The ghosts didn't help, either/или/. It was always a nasty/противный/ shock when one of
them glided suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ through a door you were trying to open. Nearly
Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right
direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked/запертый/ doors and a
trick staircase/лестница/ if you met him when you were late for class. He would
drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet/ноги/,
pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind/за/ you, invisible, grab
your nose/нос/, and screech, "GOT YOUR CONK!"

Even worse/хуже/ than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus
Filch/стащить/. Harry and Ron managed/удалось/ to get on the wrong/неправильно/ side of him on their
very first morning. Filch/стащить/ found them trying to force their way through a
door that unluckily turned/оказалось/ out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds
corridor/коридор/ on the third floor. He wouldn't believe/верить/ they were lost, was
sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening
to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor
Quirrell, who was passing.

Filch/стащить/ owned a cat called Mrs. Norris/Norris/, a scrawny, dust-colored creature
with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch/стащить/'s. She patrolled the
corridors alone/в одиночестве/. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of
line, and she'd whisk off for Filch/стащить/, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds
later. Filch/стащить/ knew the secret passageways of the school better than
anyone/кто угодно/ (except/Кроме/ perhaps the Weasley/Уизли/ twins/двойняшки/) and could pop up as suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/
as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest
ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris/Norris/ a good kick.

And then, once you had managed/удалось/ to find them, there were the classes
themselves/самих себя/. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out,
than waving your wand/палочка/ and saying a few funny words.

They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every
Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the
movements of the planets. Three times a week they went/отправился/ out to the
greenhouses behind/за/ the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little
witch/ведьма/ called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of
all the strange/странный/ plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.

Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only
one taught by a ghost/призрак/. Professor Binns had been very old

indeed/в самом деле/ when he had fallen asleep/спящий/ in front of the staff room fire and got
up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind/за/ him. Binns droned on
and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the
Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.

Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny/крошечный/ little wizard who had
to stand/стоять/ on a pile/свая/ of books to see over his desk. At the start of their
first class he took/взял/ the roll call, and when he reached/достиг/ Harry's name he
gave/дал/ an excited squeak and toppled out of sight/взгляд/.

Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite/довольно/ right to
think she wasn't a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave/дал/ them a
talking-to the moment they sat/сидел/ down in her first class.

"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you
will learn at Hogwarts," she said. "Anyone/кто угодно/ messing around in my class
will leave and not come back. You have been warned."

Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very
impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon/скоро/ realized they
weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time.
After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match
and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson,
only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor
McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and
gave/дал/ Hermione a rare smile.

The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense
Against/против/ the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned/оказалось/ out to be a bit of
a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said
was to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be
coming/приход/ back to get him one of these/эти/ days. His turban, he told them, had
been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of
a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story.
For one thing, when Seamus/Симус/ Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell
had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went/отправился/ pink and started talking about
the weather; for another, they had noticed/заметил/ that a funny smell/запах/ hung/висела/
around the turban, and the Weasley/Уизли/ twins/двойняшки/ insisted that it was stuffed
full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went/отправился/.

Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind/за/ everyone
else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't
had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to
learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start.

Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed/удалось/ to
find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost
once.

"What have we got today?" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his
porridge.

"Double Potions/зелий/ with the Slytherins," said Ron. "Snape's Head of
Slytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we'll be able/в состоянии/ to see
if it's true."

"Wish McGonagall favored us, " said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head
of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge
pile/свая/ of homework the day before.

Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten/полученный/ used to this by now, but
it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a
hundred owls/совы/ had suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ streamed into the Great Hall during/в течение/ breakfast,
circling the tables until/до/ they saw their owners, and dropping letters
and packages onto/на/ their laps.

Hedwig/Хедвиг/ hadn't brought/привел/ Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew/полетели/ in to
nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the
owlery with the other school owls/совы/. This morning, however, she fluttered
down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped/упал/ a note/заметка/ onto/на/
Harry's plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy
scrawl:


Dear Harry,

I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have
a cup of tea with me around three?

I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with
Hedwig/Хедвиг/.

Hagrid


Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the
back of the note/заметка/, and sent Hedwig/Хедвиг/ off again.

It was lucky/везучий/ that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because
the Potions/зелий/ lesson turned/оказалось/ out to be the worst thing that had happened to
him so far.

At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten/полученный/ the idea that Professor
Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions/зелий/ lesson, he knew he'd
been wrong/неправильно/. Snape didn't dislike Harry -- he hated him.

Potions/зелий/ lessons took/взял/ place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder
here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite/довольно/ creepy enough/достаточно/
without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.

Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and
like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name.

"Ah, Yes," he said softly, "Harry Potter. Our new -- celebrity."

Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe/Крэбб/ and Goyle sniggered behind/за/ their
hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His
eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none/никто/ of Hagrid's warmth.
They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.

"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of
potionmaking," he began. He spoke/говорил/ in barely more than a whisper, but
they caught/пойманный/ every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y caught/пойманный/
every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping/хранение/ a
class silent without effort. "As there is little foolish wand/палочка/-waving
here, many of you will hardly believe/верить/ this is magic. I don't expect you
will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron/котел/ with
its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through
human veins, bewitching the mind/разум/, ensnaring the senses.... I can teach
you how to bottle/бутылка/ fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren't
as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach."

More silence followed/с последующим/ this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks
with raised/поднятый/ eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and
looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead.

"Potter!" said Snape suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/. "What would I get if I added powdered
root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"

Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who
looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air.

"I don't know, sit," said Harry.

Snape's lips curled into a sneer.

"Tut, tut -- fame clearly isn't everything/все/."

He ignored Hermione's hand.

"Let's try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me
a bezoar?"

Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without
her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a
bezoar was. He tried/пытался/ not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe/Крэбб/, and Goyle, who were
shaking/сотрясение/ with laughter.

"I don't know, sit." "Thought/думал/ you wouldn't open a book before coming/приход/,
eh, Potter?" Harry forced himself/сам/ to keep looking straight/Прямо/ into those/те/
cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys', but did
Snape expect him to remember everything/все/ in One Thousand Magical Herbs
and Fungi?

Snape was still/все еще/ ignoring Hermione's quivering hand.

"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?"

At this, Hermione stood/стоял/ up, her hand stretching toward/к/ the dungeon
ceiling/потолок/.

"I don't know," said Harry quietly/тихо/. "I think Hermione does, though/хоть/, why
don't you try her?"

A few people laughed; Harry caught/пойманный/ Seamus/Симус/'s eye, and Seamus/Симус/ winked.
Snape, however, was not pleased/довольный/.

"Sit down," he snapped/щелкнул/ at Hermione. "For your information, Potter,
asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as
the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken/взятый/ from the stomach
of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and
wolfsbane, they are the same plant/растение/, which also goes/идет/ by the name of
aconite. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?"

There was a sudden/внезапный/ rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise,
Snape said, "And a point will be taken/взятый/ from Gryffindor House for your
cheek, Potter."

Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions/зелий/ lesson
continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a
simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak,
watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing
almost/почти/ everyone except/Кроме/ Malfoy, whom he seemed/казалось/ to like. He was just
telling/говоря/ everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned
slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud/громкий/ hissing filled the
dungeon. Neville had somehow/как-то/ managed/удалось/ to melt Seamus/Симус/'s cauldron/котел/ into a
twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across/через/ the stone floor,
burning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was
standing/постоянный/ on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the
potion when the cauldron/котел/ collapsed, moaned in pain/боль/ as angry red boils
sprang up all over his arms/оружие/ and legs/ноги/.

"Idiot boy!" snarled Snape, clearing/клиринг/ the spilled potion away/далеко/ with one
wave of his wand/палочка/. "I suppose/предполагать/ you added the porcupine quills before
taking the cauldron/котел/ off the fire?"

Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose/нос/.

"Take him up to the hospital wing," Snape spat at Seamus/Симус/. Then he
rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.

"You -- Potter -- why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought/думал/
he'd make you look good if he got it wrong/неправильно/, did you? That's another
point you've lost for Gryffindor."

This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked
him behind/за/ their cauldron/котел/.

"Doi* push it," he muttered/пробормотал/, "I've heard/услышанным/ Snape can turn very nasty/противный/."

As they climbed/поднялся/ the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind/разум/
was racing and his spirits were low. He'd lost two points for Gryffindor
in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much? "Cheer up,"
said Ron, "Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come
and meet Hagrid with you?"

At five to three they left the castle and made their way across/через/ the
grounds/основания/. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the
forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the
front door.

When Harry knocked/постучался/ they heard/услышанным/ a frantic scrabbling from inside and
several booming barks. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, "Back, Fang/клык/
-- back."

Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared/появился/ in the crack as he pulled the door
open.

"Hang/вешать/ on," he said. "Back, Fang/клык/."

He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous
black boarhound.

There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging/подвешивание/ from the
ceiling/потолок/, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner
stood/стоял/ a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.

"Make yerselves at home," said Hagrid, letting go of Fang/клык/, who bounded
straight/Прямо/ at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang/клык/ was
clearly not as fierce as he looked.

"This is Ron," Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a
large teapot and putting rock/камень/ cakes onto/на/ a plate.

"Another Weasley/Уизли/, eh?" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. I spent/потраченный/
half me life chasin' yer/Ер/ twin brothers away/далеко/ from the forest."

The rock/камень/ cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost/почти/ broke their
teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told
Hagrid all about their first -lessons. Fang/клык/ rested his head on Harry's
knee and drooled all over his robes/робы/.

Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch "that old git."

"An' as fer/фер/ that cat, Mrs. Norris/Norris/, I'd like ter/тер/ introduce her to Fang/клык/
sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter/тер/ the school, she follows me
everywhere? Can't get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it."

Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not
to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.

"But he seemed/казалось/ to really hate me."

"Rubbish!" said Hagrid. "Why should he?"

Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite/довольно/ meet his eyes
when he said that.

"How's yer/Ер/ brother Charlie?" Hagrid asked Ron. "I liked him a lot --
great with animals."

Harry wondered/задавались вопросом/ if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron
told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked/выбрал/ up a
piece of paper that was lying/лежащий/ on the table under the tea cozy. It was a
cutting from the Daily Prophet:

GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST

Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July,
widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.

Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken/взятый/. The vault/свод/
that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.

"But we're not telling/говоря/ you what was in there, so keep your noses out if
you know what's good for you," said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this
afternoon.

Harry remembered/вспомнил/ Ron telling/говоря/ him on the train that someone/кто то/ had tried/пытался/ to
rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.

"Hagrid!" said Harry, "that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday!
It might've been happening while we were there!"

There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes
this time. He grunted and offered him another rock/камень/ cake. Harry read the
story again. The vault/свод/ that was searched had in fact been emptied
earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault/свод/ seven hundred and
thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little
package/пакет/. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?

As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets/карманы/
weighed down with rock/камень/ cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry
thought/думал/ that none/никто/ of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much
to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package/пакет/
just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about
Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry?


CHAPTER NINE

THE MIDNIGHT DUEL

Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley,
but that was before he met Draco Malfoy.	Still/все еще/, first-year
Gryffindors only had Potions/зелий/ with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to
put up with Malfoy much. Or at least/наименее/, they didn't until/до/ they spotted/пятнистый/ a
notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan.
Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor and
Slytherin	would be learning together.

"Typical," said Harry darkly. "Just what I always wanted. To make a fool
of myself on a broomstick/метловище/ in front of Malfoy."

He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.

"You don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself/сам/," said Ron
reasonably. "Anyway/так или иначе/, I know Malfoy's always going on about how good he
is at Quidditch, but I bet/делать ставку/ that's all talk."

Malfay certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly/громко/ about
first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long,
boastful stories that always seemed/казалось/ to end with him narrowly escaping
Muggles in helicopters. He wasn't the only one, though/хоть/: the way Seamus/Симус/
Finnigan told it, he'd spent/потраченный/ most of his childhood zooming around the
countryside on his broomstick/метловище/. Even Ron would tell anyone/кто угодно/ who'd listen
about the time he'd almost/почти/ hit a hang/вешать/ glider on Charlie's old broom/метла/.
Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron
had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their
dormitory/общежитие/, about soccer. Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game
with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught/пойманный/ Ron
prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the
players move.

Neville had never been on a broomstick/метловище/ in his life, because his
grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt/почувствовал/ she'd had
good reason, because Neville managed/удалось/ to have an extraordinary number of
accidents even with both feet/ноги/ on the ground/земля/.

Hermione Granger was almost/почти/ as nervous about flying as Neville was. This
was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book -- not that she
hadn't tried/пытался/. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with
flying tips she'd gotten/полученный/ out of a library book called Quidditch Through
the Ages. Neville was hanging/подвешивание/ on to her every word, desperate for
anything that might help him hang/вешать/ on to his broomstick/метловище/ later, but
everybody else was very pleased/довольный/ when Hermione's lecture was interrupted
by the arrival of the mail.

Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note/заметка/, something that
Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy's eagle owl/сова/ was
always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened
gloatingly at the Slytherin table.

A barn owl/сова/ brought/привел/ Neville a small package/пакет/ from his grandmother. He
opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large
marble, which seemed/казалось/ to be full of white smoke.

"It's a Remembrall!" he explained. "Gran knows I forget/забывать/ things -- this
tells you if there's something you've forgotten/забытый/ to do. Look, you hold it
tight like this and if it turns red -- oh..." His face fell/упал/, because the
Remembrall had suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ glowed scarlet,

"You've forgotten/забытый/ something..."

Neville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten/забытый/ when Draco Malfoy,
who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his
hand.

Harry and Ron jumped to their feet/ноги/. They were half hoping/надеясь/ for a reason
to fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble/беда/
quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.

"What's going on?"

"Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor."

Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped/упал/ the Remembrall back on the table.

"Just looking," he said, and he sloped away/далеко/ with Crabbe/Крэбб/ and Goyle behind/за/
him.

At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors
hurried/торопливый/ down the front steps onto/на/ the grounds/основания/ for their first flying
lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their
feet/ноги/ as they marched down the sloping lawns toward/к/ a smooth, flat lawn
on the opposite side of the grounds/основания/ to the forbidden forest, whose trees
were swaying darkly in the distance.

The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying/лежащий/
in neat lines on the ground/земля/. Harry had heard/услышанным/ Fred and George Weasley/Уизли/
complain about the school brooms/веники/, saying that some of them started to
vibrate if you flew/полетели/ too high, or always flew/полетели/ slightly to the left.

Their teacher, Madam Hooch/самогон/, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and
yellow eyes like a hawk.

"Well, what are you all waiting for?" she barked. "Everyone stand/стоять/ by a
broomstick/метловище/. Come on, hurry/торопиться/ up."

Harry glanced down at his broom/метла/. It was old and some of the twigs stuck
out at odd/странный/ angles.

"Stick/придерживаться/ out your right hand over your broom/метла/," called Madam Hooch/самогон/ at the
front, "and say 'Up!"'

"UPF everyone shouted/кричал/.

Harry's broom/метла/ jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few
that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled/прокат/ over on the ground/земля/, and
Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms/веники/, like horses, could tell
when you were afraid, thought/думал/ Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's
voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet/ноги/ on the
ground/земля/.

Madam Hooch/самогон/ then showed them how to mount their brooms/веники/ without sliding
off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.
Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it
wrong/неправильно/ for years.

"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground/земля/, hard," said
Madam Hooch/самогон/. "Keep your brooms/веники/ steady, rise a few feet/ноги/, and then come
straight/Прямо/ back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three
-- two --"

But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being/являющийся/ left on the
ground/земля/, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch/самогон/'s
lips.

"Come back, boy!" she shouted/кричал/, but Neville was rising straight/Прямо/ up like a
cork shot out of a bottle/бутылка/ -- twelve feet/ноги/ -- twenty feet/ноги/. Harry saw his
scared/испуганный/ white face look down at the ground/земля/ falling away/далеко/, saw him gasp,
slip sideways off the broom/метла/ and --

WHAM -- a thud and a nasty/противный/ crack and Neville lay/прокладывать/ facedown on the grass
in a heap. His broomstick/метловище/ was still/все еще/ rising higher and higher, and
started to drift lazily toward/к/ the forbidden forest and out of sight/взгляд/.

Madam Hooch/самогон/ was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.

"Broken wrist," Harry heard/услышанным/ her mutter. "Come on, boy -- it's all right,
up you get.".

She turned/оказалось/ to the rest/отдых/ of the class.

"None/никто/ of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You
leave those/те/ brooms/веники/ where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before
you can say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear."

Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with
Madam Hooch/самогон/, who had her arm/рука/ around him.

No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst/взрыв/ into laughter.

"Did you see his face, the great lump?"

The other Slytherins joined/присоединился/ in.

"Shut/закрыть/ up, Malfoy," snapped/щелкнул/ Parvati Patil.

"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced
Slytherin girl. "Never thought/думал/ you'd like fat little crybabies,
Parvati."

"Look!" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the
grass. "It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him."

The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held/Ручной/ it up.

"Give that here, Malfoy," said Harry quietly/тихо/. Everyone stopped talking
to watch.

Malfoy smiled nastily.

"I think I'll leave it somewhere/где-то/ for Longbottom to find -- how about --
up a tree?"

"Give it here!" Harry yelled/вопил/, but Malfoy had leapt/прыгнула/ onto/на/ his broomstick/метловище/
and taken/взятый/ off. He hadn't been lying/лежащий/, he could fly well. Hovering level
with the topmost branches of an oak he called, "Come and get it,
Potter!"

Harry grabbed/схватил/ his broom/метла/.

"No!" shouted/кричал/ Hermione Granger. "Madam Hooch/самогон/ told us not to move --
you'll get us all into trouble/беда/."

Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom/метла/
and kicked hard against/против/ the ground/земля/ and up, up he soared; air rushed
through his hair, and his robes/робы/ whipped out behind/за/ him -and in a rush of
fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being/являющийся/
taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick/метловище/ up
a little to take it even higher, and heard/услышанным/ screams and gasps of girls
back on the ground/земля/ and an admiring whoop from Ron.

He turned/оказалось/ his broomstick/метловище/ sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked
stunned.

"Give it here," Harry called, "or I'll knock you off that broom/метла/!" "Oh,
yeah?" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.

Harry knew, somehow/как-то/, what to do. He leaned/подался/ forward and grasped the broom/метла/
tightly in both hands, and it shot toward/к/ Malfay like a javelin. Malfoy
only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp/резкое/ about-face and
held/Ручной/ the broom/метла/ steady. A few people below were clapping.

"No Crabbe/Крэбб/ and Goyle up here to save your neck/шея/, Malfoy," Harry called.

The same thought/думал/ seemed/казалось/ to have struck Malfoy.

"Catch/поймать/ it if you can, then!" he shouted/кричал/, and he threw/бросил/ the glass ball
high into the air and streaked back toward/к/ the ground/земля/.

Harry saw, as though/хоть/ in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and
then start to fall/падать/. He leaned/подался/ forward and pointed/заостренный/ his broom/метла/ handle down
-- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball
-- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people
watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground/земля/ he
caught/пойманный/ it, just in time to pull his broom/метла/ straight/Прямо/, and he toppled
gently onto/на/ the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.

"HARRY POTTER!"

His heart sank faster than he'd just dived. Professor McGonagall was
running toward/к/ them. He got to his feet/ноги/, trembling.

"Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts --"

Professor McGonagall was almost/почти/ speechless with shock, and her glasses
flashed furiously/бешено/, "-- how dare/сметь/ you -- might have broken your neck/шея/ --"

"It wasn't his fault, Professor --"

"Be quiet/тихо/, Miss Patil

"But Malfoy --"

"That's enough/достаточно/, Mr. Weasley/Уизли/. Potter, follow me, now."

Harry caught/пойманный/ sight/взгляд/ of Malfoy, Crabbe/Крэбб/, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he
left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward/к/
the castle. He was going to be expelled/исключенный/, he just knew it. He wanted to
say something to defend himself/сам/, but there seemed/казалось/ to be something wrong/неправильно/
with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along/вдоль/ without even
looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he'd done it. He hadn't
even lasted two weeks. He'd be packing his bags in ten minutes. What
would the Dursleys say when he turned/оказалось/ up on the doorstep?

Up the front steps, up the marble staircase/лестница/ inside, and still/все еще/ Professor
McGonagall didn't say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched
along/вдоль/ corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind/за/ her. Maybe she was
taking him to Dumbledore. He thought/думал/ of Hagrid, expelled/исключенный/ but allowed to
stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant. His
stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming
wizards, while he stumped around the grounds/основания/ carrying/проведение/ Hagrid's bag.

Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door
and poked her head inside.

"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?"

Wood? thought/думал/ Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on
him?

But Wood turned/оказалось/ out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out
of Flitwicles class looking confused.

"Follow me, you two," said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up
the corridor/коридор/, Wood looking curiously at Harry.

"In here."

Professor McGonagall pointed/заостренный/ them into a classroom that was empty except/Кроме/
for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.

"Out, Peeves!" she barked. Peeves threw/бросил/ the chalk into a bin/бункер/, which
clanged loudly/громко/, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed
the door behind/за/ him and turned/оказалось/ to face the two boys.

"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood -- I've found you a Seeker/искатель/."

Wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight.

"Are you serious, Professor?"

"Absolutely," said Professor McGonagall crisply. "The boy's a natural.
I've never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a
broomstick/метловище/, Potter?"

Harry nodded/кивнул/ silently. He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he
didn't seem/казаться/ to be being/являющийся/ expelled/исключенный/, and some of the feeling started coming/приход/
back to his legs/ноги/.

"He caught/пойманный/ that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive," Professor
McGonagall told Wood. "Didn't even scratch himself/сам/. Charlie Weasley/Уизли/
couldn't have done it."

Wood was now looking as though/хоть/ all his dreams had come true at once.

"Ever/Когда-либо/ seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?" he asked excitedly.

"Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team," Professor McGonagall explained.

"He's just the build for a Seeker/искатель/, too," said Wood, now walking around
Harry and staring/уставившись/ at him. "Light -- speedy -- we'll have to get him a
decent broom/метла/, Professor -- a Nimbus/нимб/ Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven,
I'd say."

I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the
first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year.
Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape
in the face for weeks...."

Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.

"I want to hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind/разум/
about punishing you."

Then she suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ smiled.

"Your father would have been proud," she said. "He was an excellent
Quidditch player himself/сам/."

"You're joking."

It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling/говоря/ Ron what had happened
when he'd left the grounds/основания/ with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of
steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten/забытый/ all about
it.

"Seeker/искатель/?" he said. "But first years never -- you must be the youngest
house player in about a century, said Harry, shoveling pie into his
mouth. He felt/почувствовал/ particularly hungry after the excitement of the
afternoon. "Wood told me."

Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat/сидел/ and gaped at Harry.

"I start training next week," said Harry. "Only don't tell anyone/кто угодно/, Wood
wants to keep it a secret."

Fred and George Weasley/Уизли/ now came into the hall, spotted/пятнистый/ Harry, and
hurried/торопливый/ over.

"Well done," said George in a low voice. "Wood told us. We're on the
team too -- Beaters."

"I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,"
said Fred. "We haven't won/выиграл/ since Charlie left, but this year's team is
going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost/почти/ skipping
when he told us."

"Anyway/так или иначе/, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new secret
passageway out of the school."

"Bet/делать ставку/ it's that one behind/за/ the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found
in our first week. See you."

Fred and George had hardly disappeared/исчез/ when someone/кто то/ far less welcome
turned/оказалось/ up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe/Крэбб/ and Goyle.

"Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the
Muggles?"

"You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground/земля/ and you've got
your little friends with you," said Harry coolly. There was of course
nothing at all little about Crabbe/Крэбб/ and Goyle, but as the High Table was
full of teachers, neither/ни/ of them could do more than crack their
knuckles and scowl.

"I'd take you on anytime on my own," said Malfoy. "Tonight, if you want.
Wizard's duel. Wands/палочки/ only -- no contact. What's the matter/дело/? Never heard/услышанным/
of a wizard's duel before, I suppose/предполагать/?"

"Of course he has," said Ron, wheeling around. "I'm his second, who's
yours?"

Malfoy looked at Crabbe/Крэбб/ and Goyle, sizing them up.

"Crabbe/Крэбб/," he said. "Midnight all right? We'll meet you in the trophy
room; that's always unlocked."

When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. "What is a
wizard's duel?" said Harry. "And what do you mean, you're my second?"

"Well, a second's there to take over if you die," said Ron casually,
getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry's
face, he added quickly, "But people only die in proper duels, you know,
with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy'll be able/в состоянии/ to do is send
sparks at each other. Neither/ни/ of you knows enough/достаточно/ magic to do any real
damage. I bet/делать ставку/ he expected/ожидаемый/ you to refuse, anyway/так или иначе/."

"And what if I wave my wand/палочка/ and nothing happens?"

"Throw it away/далеко/ and punch him on the nose/нос/," Ron suggested. "Excuse me."

They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.

"Can't a person eat in peace in this place?" said Ron.

Hermione ignored him and spoke/говорил/ to Harry.

"I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying --"

"Bet/делать ставку/ you could," Ron muttered/пробормотал/.

"--and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the
points you'll lose/потерять/ Gryffindor if you're caught/пойманный/, and you're bound to be.
It's really very selfish of you."

"And it's really none/никто/ of your business," said Harry.

"Good-bye," said Ron.

All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day,
Harry thought/думал/, as he lay/прокладывать/ awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus/Симус/
falling asleep/спящий/ (Neville wasn't back from the hospital wing). Ron had
spent/потраченный/ all evening giving him advice such as "If he tries to curse/проклятие/ you,
you'd better dodge it, because I can't remember how to block them."
There was a very good chance they were going to get caught/пойманный/ by Filch/стащить/ or
Mrs. Norris/Norris/, and Harry felt/почувствовал/ he was pushing his luck, breaking another
school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoys sneering face kept/держали/ looming
up out of the darkness - this was his big chance to beat Malfoy
face-to-face. He couldn't miss it.

"Half-past eleven," Ron muttered/пробормотал/ at last, "we'd better go."

They pulled on their bathrobes, picked/выбрал/ up their wands/палочки/, and crept/подкрался/ across/через/
the tower room, down the spiral staircase/лестница/, and into the Gryffindor
common room. A few embers were still/все еще/ glowing in the fireplace, turning/превращение/
all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost/почти/ reached/достиг/
the portrait hole when a voice spoke/говорил/ from the chair nearest them, "I
can't believe/верить/ you're going to do this, Harry."

A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing/носить/ a pink bathrobe
and a frown.

"You!" said Ron furiously/бешено/. "Go back to bed!"

"I almost/почти/ told your brother," Hermione snapped/щелкнул/, "Percy -- he's a
prefect, he'd put a stop to this."

Harry couldn't believe/верить/ anyone/кто угодно/ could be so interfering.

"Come on," he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady
and climbed/поднялся/ through the hole.

Hermione wasn't going to give up that easily. She followed/с последующим/ Ron through
the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.

"Don't you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I
don't want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you'll lose/потерять/ all the
points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing/знание/ about Switching
Spells."

"Go away/далеко/." "All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said
when you're on the train home tomorrow, you're so --"

But what they were, they didn't find out. Hermione had turned/оказалось/ to the
portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an
empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione
was locked/запертый/ out of Gryffindor tower.

"Now what am I going to do?" she asked shrilly.

"That's your problem," said Ron. "We've got to go, we 3 re going to be
late."

They hadn't even reached/достиг/ the end of the corridor/коридор/ when Hermione caught/пойманный/ up
with them.

"I'm coming/приход/ with you," she said.

"You are not."

"D'you think I'm going to stand/стоять/ out here and wait for Filch/стащить/ to catch/поймать/ me?
If he finds all three of us I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying
to stop you, and you can back me up."

"You've got some nerve --" said Ron loudly/громко/.

"Shut/закрыть/ up, both of you!" said Harry sharply. I heard/услышанным/ something."

It was a sort of snuffling.

"Mrs. Norris/Norris/?" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.

It wasn't Mrs. Norris/Norris/. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor,
fast asleep/спящий/, but jerked/рывком/ suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ awake as they crept/подкрался/ nearer/ближе/.

"Thank goodness you found me! I've been out here for hours, I couldn't
remember the new password to get in to bed."

"Keep your voice down, Neville. The password's 'Pig snout' but it won/выиграл/'t
help you now, the Fat Lady's gone off somewhere/где-то/."

"How's your arm/рука/?" said Harry.

"Fine," said Neville, showing them. "Madam Pomfrey/Помфрей/ mended it in about a
minute."

"Good - well, look, Neville, we've got to be somewhere/где-то/, we'll see you
later --"

"Don't leave me!" said Neville, scrambling to his feet/ноги/, "I don't want to
stay here alone/в одиночестве/, the Bloody Baron's been past twice already."

Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously/бешено/ at Hermione and
Neville.

"If either/или/ of you get us caught/пойманный/, I'll never rest/отдых/ until/до/ I've learned that
Curse/проклятие/ of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.

Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly/в точку/ how to use the
Curse/проклятие/ of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet/тихо/ and beckoned
them all forward.

They flitted along/вдоль/ corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the
high windows. At every turn Harry expected/ожидаемый/ to run into Filch/стащить/ or Mrs.
Norris/Norris/, but they were lucky/везучий/. They sped up a staircase/лестница/ to the third floor
and tiptoed toward/к/ the trophy room.

Malfoy and Crabbe/Крэбб/ weren't there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered
where the moonlight caught/пойманный/ them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues
winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along/вдоль/ the walls,
keeping/хранение/ their eyes on the doors at either/или/ end of the room. Harry took/взял/
out his wand/палочка/ in case Malfoy leapt/прыгнула/ in and started at once. The minutes
crept/подкрался/ by.

"He's late, maybe he's chickened out," Ron whispered/прошептал/.

Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised/поднятый/
his wand/палочка/ when they heard/услышанным/ someone/кто то/ speak -and it wasn't Malfoy.

"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner."

It was Filch/стащить/ speaking to Mrs. Norris/Norris/. Horror/ужастик/-struck, Harry waved/махал/ madly
at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried
silently toward/к/ the door, away/далеко/ from Filch/стащить/'s voice. Neville's robes/робы/ had
barely whipped round the corner when they heard/услышанным/ Filch/стащить/ enter the trophy
room.

"They're in here somewhere/где-то/," they heard/услышанным/ him mutter, "probably/вероятно/ hiding."

"This way!" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to
creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch/стащить/
getting nearer/ближе/. Neville suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ let out a frightened squeak and broke
into a run -he tripped, grabbed/схватил/ Ron around the waist, and the pair of
them toppled right into a suit of armor.

The clanging and crashing were enough/достаточно/ to wake the whole castle.

"RUN!" Harry yelled/вопил/, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not
looking back to see whether Filch/стащить/ was following -- they swung/качнулся/ around the
doorpost and galloped down one corridor/коридор/ then another, Harry in the lead,
without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped
through a tapestry and found themselves/самих себя/ in a hidden passageway, hurtled
along/вдоль/ it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was
miles from the trophy room.

"I think we've lost him," Harry panted, leaning against/против/ the cold wall
and wiping his forehead/лоб/. Neville was bent/изогнутый/ double, wheezing and
spluttering.

I -- told -you," Hermione gasped/ахнула/, clutching at the stitch in her chest,
"I -- told -- you."

"We've got to get back to Gryffindor tower," said Ron, "quickly as
possible."

"Malfoy tricked you," Hermione said to Harry. "You realize that, don't
you? He was never going to meet you -- Filch/стащить/ knew someone/кто то/ was going to
be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off."

Harry thought/думал/ she was probably/вероятно/ right, but he wasn't going to tell her
that.

"Let's go."

It wasn't going to be that simple. They hadn't gone more than a dozen
paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a
classroom in front of them.

It was Peeves. He caught/пойманный/ sight/взгляд/ of them and gave/дал/ a squeal of delight.

"Shut/закрыть/ up, Peeves -- please -- you'll get us thrown out."

Peeves cackled.

"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty,
naughty, you'll get caughty."

"Not if you don't give us away/далеко/, Peeves, please."

"Should tell Filch/стащить/, I should," said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his
eyes glittered wickedly. "It's for your own good, you know."

"Get out of the way," snapped/щелкнул/ Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a
big mistake.

"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!" Peeves bellowed, "STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE
CHARMS CORRIDOR/коридор/"

Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the
corridor/коридор/ where they slammed into a door -- and it was locked/запертый/.

"This is it!" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, "We're
done for! This is the end!" They could hear footsteps, Filch/стащить/ running as
fast as he could toward/к/ Peeves's shouts.

"Oh, move over," Hermione snarled. She grabbed/схватил/ Harry's wand/палочка/, tapped the
lock, and whispered/прошептал/, 'Alohomora!"

The lock clicked and the door swung/качнулся/ open -- they piled through it, shut/закрыть/
it quickly, and pressed their ears against/против/ it, listening.

"Which way did they go, Peeves?" Filch/стащить/ was saying. "Quick, tell me."

"Say 'please."'

"Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?"

"Shan't say nothing if you don't say please," said Peeves in his
annoying singsong voice.

"All right -please."

"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say
please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!" And they heard/услышанным/ the sound of Peeves whooshing
away/далеко/ and Filch/стащить/ cursing in rage.

"He thinks this door is locked/запертый/," Harry whispered/прошептал/. "I think we'll be okay
-- get off, Neville!" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of
Harry's bathrobe for the last minute. "What?"

Harry turned/оказалось/ around -- and saw, quite/довольно/ clearly, what. For a moment, he
was sure he'd walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of
everything/все/ that had happened so far.

They weren't in a room, as he had supposed/предполагаемый/. They were in a corridor/коридор/. The
forbidden corridor/коридор/ on the third floor. And now they knew why it was
forbidden.

They were looking straight/Прямо/ into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that
filled the whole space between ceiling/потолок/ and floor. It had three heads/руководители/.
Three pairs of rolling, mad/Сумасшедший/ eyes; three noses, twitching

and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging/подвешивание/
in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.

It was standing/постоянный/ quite/довольно/ still/все еще/, all six eyes staring/уставившись/ at them, and Harry
knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their
sudden/внезапный/ appearance had taken/взятый/ it by surprise, but it was quickly getting
over that, there was no mistaking what those/те/ thunderous growls meant.

Harry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch/стащить/ and death, he'd take
Filch/стащить/.

They fell/упал/ backward -- Harry slammed the door shut/закрыть/, and they ran, they
almost/почти/ flew/полетели/, back down the corridor/коридор/. Filch/стащить/ must have hurried/торопливый/ off to look
for them somewhere/где-то/ else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they
hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible
between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until/до/ they
reached/достиг/ the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.

"Where on earth have you all been?" she asked, looking at their
bathrobes hanging/подвешивание/ off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.

"Never mind/разум/ that -- pig snout, pig snout," panted Harry, and the
portrait swung/качнулся/ forward. They scrambled into the common room and
collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.

It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed/в самом деле/, looked
as if he'd never speak again.

"What do they think they're doing, keeping/хранение/ a thing like that locked/запертый/ up
in a school?" said Ron finally. "If any dog needs exercise, that one
does."

Hermione had got both her breath/дыхание/ and her bad temper back again. "You
don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?" she snapped/щелкнул/. "Didn't you see
what it was standing/постоянный/ on.

"The floor?" Harry suggested. "I wasn't looking at its feet/ноги/, I was too
busy with its heads/руководители/."

"No, not the floor. It was standing/постоянный/ on a trapdoor/люк/. It's obviously/очевидно/
guarding/охранные/ something."

She stood/стоял/ up, glaring at them.

I hope you're pleased/довольный/ with yourselves. We could all have been killed --
or worse/хуже/, expelled/исключенный/. Now, if you don't mind/разум/, I'm going to bed."

Ron stared after her, his mouth open.

"No, we don't mind/разум/," he said. "You'd think we dragged her along/вдоль/,
wouldn't you.

But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed/поднялся/
back into bed. The dog was guarding/охранные/ something.... What had Hagrid said?
Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to
hide -- except/Кроме/ perhaps Hogwarts.

It looked as though/хоть/ Harry had found out where the grubby littie package/пакет/
from vault/свод/ seven hundred and thirteen was.


CHAPTER TEN

HALLOWEEN

Malfoy couldn't believe/верить/ his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were
still/все еще/ at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
Indeed/в самом деле/, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought/думал/ that meeting the
three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite/довольно/
keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the
package/пакет/ that seemed/казалось/ to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and
they spent/потраченный/ a lot of time wondering/интересно/ what could possibly need such heavy
protection. "It's either/или/ really valuable or really dangerous," said Ron.
"Or both," said Harry.


But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it
was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what
it was without further clues.

Neither/ни/ Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay/прокладывать/
underneath/под/ the dog and the trapdoor/люк/. All Neville cared about was never
going near the dog again.

Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a
bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really
wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great
delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.

As the owls/совы/ flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention
was caught/пойманный/ at once by a long, thin/тонкий/ package/пакет/ carried/осуществляется/ by six large screech
owls/совы/. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in
this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls/совы/ soared down and dropped/упал/
it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had
hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl/сова/ dropped/упал/ a letter on top
of the parcel.

Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky/везучий/, because it said:


DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.

It contains your new Nimbus/нимб/ Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody
knowing/знание/ you've got a broomstick/метловище/ or they'll all want one. Oliver Wood
will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your
first training session.

Professor McGonagall

Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note/заметка/ to Ron to
read.

"A Nimbus/нимб/ Two Thousand!" Ron moaned enviously. "I've never even touched
one."

They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick/метловище/ in private
before their first class, but halfway across/через/ the entrance hall they
found the way upstairs/вверх по лестнице/ barred by Crabbe/Крэбб/ and Goyle. Malfoy seized/захватили/ the
package/пакет/ from Harry and felt/почувствовал/ it.

"That's a broomstick/метловище/," he said, throwing/бросание/ it back to Harry with a mixture
of jealousy and spite on his face. "You'll be in for it this time,
Potter, first years aren't allowed them."

Ron couldn't resist it.

"It's not any old broomstick/метловище/," he said, "it's a Nimbus/нимб/ Two Thousand.
What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?" Ron
grinned at Harry. "Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same
league as the Nimbus/нимб/."

"What would you know about it, Weasley/Уизли/, you couldn't afford half the
handle," Malfoy snapped/щелкнул/ back. "I suppose/предполагать/ you and your brothers have to
save up twig by twig."

Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared/появился/ at Malfoy's elbow.

"Not arguing, I hope, boys?" he squeaked.

"Potter's been sent a broomstick/метловище/, Professor," said Malfoy quickly.

"Yes, yes, that's right," said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.
"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances,
Potter. And what model is it?"

"A Nimbus/нимб/ Two Thousand, sit," said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the
look of horror/ужастик/ on Malfoy's face. "And it's really thanks to Malfoy here
that I've got it," he added.

Harry and Ron headed upstairs/вверх по лестнице/, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's
obvious rage and confusion. "Well, it's true," Harry chortled as they
reached/достиг/ the top of the marble staircase/лестница/, "If he hadn't stolen Neville's
Remembrall I wouln't be on the team...."

"So I suppose/предполагать/ you think that's a reward for breaking rules?" came an
angry voice from just behind/за/ them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs/лестница/,
looking disapprovingly at the package/пакет/ in Harry's hand.

"I thought/думал/ you weren't speaking to us?" said Harry.

"Yes, don't stop now," said Ron, "it's doing us so much good."

Hermione marched away/далеко/ with her nose/нос/ in the air.

Harry had a lot of trouble/беда/ keeping/хранение/ his mind/разум/ on his lessons that day. It
kept/держали/ wandering up to the dormitory/общежитие/ where his new broomstick/метловище/ was lying/лежащий/
under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be
learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without
noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs/вверх по лестнице/ with Ron to unwrap
the Nimbus/нимб/ Two Thousand at last.

"Wow," Ron sighed, as the broomstick/метловище/ rolled/прокат/ onto/на/ Harry's bedspread.

Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms/веники/, thought/думал/ it
looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long
tail of neat, straight/Прямо/ twigs and Nimbus/нимб/ Two Thousand written in gold
near the top.

As seven o'clock drew nearer/ближе/, Harry left the castle and set off in the
dusk toward/к/ the Quidditch field. Held/Ручной/ never been inside the stadium
before. Hundreds of seats were raised/поднятый/ in stands around the field so that
the spectators were high enough/достаточно/ to see what was going on. At either/или/ end
of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They
reminded/напомнил/ Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle

children blew bubbles through, except/Кроме/ that they were fifty feet/ноги/ high.

Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick/метловище/
and kicked off from the ground/земля/. What a feeling -- he swooped in and out
of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus/нимб/ Two
Thousand turned/оказалось/ wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.

"Hey, Potter, come down!'

Oliver Wood had arrived. fie was carrying/проведение/ a large wooden crate/клеть/ under his
arm/рука/. Harry landed/высадился/ next to him.

"Very nice," said Wood, his eyes glinting. "I see what McGonagall
meant... you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules
this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week."

He opened the crate/клеть/. Inside were four different-sized balls.

"Right," said Wood. "Now, Quidditch is easy enough/достаточно/ to understand, even
if it's not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side.
Three of them are called Chasers."

"Three Chasers," Harry repeated, as Wood took/взял/ out a bright/яркий/ red ball
about the size of a soccer ball.

"This ball's called the Quaffle/Кваффл/," said Wood. "The Chasers throw the
Quaffle/Кваффл/ to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to
score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle/Кваффл/ goes/идет/ through one of the
hoops. Follow me?"

"The Chasers throw the Quaffle/Кваффл/ and put it through the hoops to score,"
Harry recited. "So -- that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with
six hoops, isn't it?"

"What's basketball?" said Wood curiously. "Never mind/разум/," said Harry
quickly.

"Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper/хранитель/ -I'm
Keeper/хранитель/ for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other
team from scoring."

"Three Chasers, one Keeper/хранитель/," said Harry, who was determined to remember
it all. "And they play with the Quaffle/Кваффл/. Okay, got that. So what are
they for?" He pointed/заостренный/ at the three balls left inside the box.

"I'll show you now," said Wood. "Take this."

He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.

"I'm going to show you what the Bludgers/бладжеры/ do," Wood said. "These/эти/ two are
the Bludgers/бладжеры/."

He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than
the red Quaffle/Кваффл/. Harry noticed/заметил/ that they seemed/казалось/ to be straining to
escape the straps holding them inside the box.

"Stand/стоять/ back," Wood warned Harry. He bent/изогнутый/ down and freed one of the
Bludgers/бладжеры/.

At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight/Прямо/ at
Harry's face. Harry swung/качнулся/ at it with the bat to stop it from breaking
his nose/нос/, and sent it zigzagging away/далеко/ into the air -- it zoomed around
their heads/руководители/ and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed/удалось/ to
pin it to the ground/земля/.

"See?" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate/клеть/
and strapping it down safely. "The Bludgers/бладжеры/ rocket around, trying to
knock players off their brooms/веники/. That's why you have two Beaters on each
team -- the Weasley/Уизли/ twins/двойняшки/ are ours -- it's their job to protect their
side from the Bludgers/бладжеры/ and try and knock them toward/к/ the other team. So
-- think you've got all that?"

"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle/Кваффл/; the Keeper/хранитель/ guards the
goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers/бладжеры/ away/далеко/ from their team," Harry
reeled off.

"Very good," said Wood.

"Er/эр/ -- have the Bludgers/бладжеры/ ever/Когда-либо/ killed anyone/кто угодно/?" Harry asked, hoping/надеясь/ he
sounded offhand.

"Never at Hogwarts. We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse/хуже/
than that. Now, the last member of the team is the

Seeker/искатель/. That's you. And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle/Кваффл/ or the
Bludgers/бладжеры/ unless/если/ they crack my head open."

"Don't worry, the Weasleys/Уизли/ are more than a match for the Bludgers/бладжеры/ -- I
mean, they're like a pair of human Bludgers/бладжеры/ themselves/самих себя/."

Wood reached/достиг/ into the crate/клеть/ and took/взял/ out the fourth and last ball.
Compared with the Quaffle/Кваффл/ and the Bludgers/бладжеры/, it was tiny/крошечный/, about the size
of a large walnut. It was bright/яркий/ gold and had little fluttering silver
wings.

"This," said Wood, "is the Golden Snitch/доносчик/, and it's the most important
ball of the lot. It's very hard to catch/поймать/ because it's so fast and
difficult to see. It's the Seeker/искатель/'s job to catch/поймать/ it. You've got to weave
in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers/бладжеры/, and Quaffle/Кваффл/ to get it
before the other team's Seeker/искатель/, because whichever Seeker/искатель/ catches the
Snitch/доносчик/ wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they

nearly always win. That's why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of
Quidditch only ends when the Snitch/доносчик/ is caught/пойманный/, so it can go on for ages
-- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on
substitutes so the players could get some sleep. "Well, that's it -- any
questions?"

Harry shook/встряхнул/ his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was
doing it that was going to be the problem.

"We won/выиграл/'t practice with the Snitch/доносчик/ yet," said Wood, carefully shutting
it back inside the crate/клеть/, "it's too dark, we might lose/потерять/ it. Let's try
you out with a few of these/эти/."

He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket/карман/ and a few
minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing/бросание/ the golf
balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch/поймать/.

Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an
hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on.

"That Quidditch cup'll have our name on it this year," said Wood happily
as they trudged back up to the castle. "I wouldn't be surprised if you
turn out better than Charlie Weasley/Уизли/, and he could have played for
England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons."

Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice
three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly
believe/верить/ it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two
months. The castle felt/почувствовал/ more like home than Privet/бирючина/ Drive ever/Когда-либо/ had. His
lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had
mastered the basics.

On Halloween morning they woke/просыпался/ to the delicious smell/запах/ of baking pumpkin
wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced
in Charms that he thought/думал/ they were ready to start making objects fly,
something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make
Neville's toad/жаба/ zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the
class into pairs to practice. Harry's partner was Seamus/Симус/ Finnigan (which
was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch/поймать/ his eye). Ron,
however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell
whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn't spoken to
either/или/ of them since the day Harry's broomstick/метловище/ had arrived.

"Now, don't forget/забывать/ that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!"
squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile/свая/ of books as
usual. "Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic
words properly is very important, too -- never forget/забывать/ Wizard Baruffio,
who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself/сам/ on the floor with a
buffalo on his chest."

It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus/Симус/ swished and flicked, but the
feather they were supposed/предполагаемый/ to be sending skyward just lay/прокладывать/ on the
desktop. Seamus/Симус/ got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand/палочка/ and
set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat/шапка/.

Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck.

"Wingardium Leviosa!" he shouted/кричал/, waving his long arms/оружие/ like a windmill.

"You're saying it wrong/неправильно/," Harry heard/услышанным/ Hermione snap. "It's Wing-gar-dium
Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long."


"You do it, then, if you're so clever," Ron snarled.

Hermione rolled/прокат/ up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand/палочка/, and said,
"Wingardium Leviosa!"

Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet/ноги/ above/выше/ their
heads/руководители/.

"Oh, well done!" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. "Everyone see here,
Miss Granger's done it!"

Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. "It's no wonder/задаваться вопросом/ no
one can stand/стоять/ her," he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the
crowded corridor/коридор/, "she's a nightmare, honestly. "

Someone/кто то/ knocked/постучался/ into Harry as they hurried/торопливый/ past him. It was Hermione.
Harry caught/пойманный/ a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she
was in tears.

"I think she heard/услышанным/ you."

"So?" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. "She must've noticed/заметил/
she's got no friends."

Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all
afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast,
Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling/говоря/ her friend Lavender that
Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone/в одиночестве/.
Ron looked still/все еще/ more awkward at this, but a moment later they had
entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out
of their minds.

A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling/потолок/ while a
thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the
candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared/появился/ suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ on the
golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.

Harry was just helping himself/сам/ to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell
came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face.
Everyone stared as he reached/достиг/ Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped
against/против/ the table, and gasped/ахнула/, "Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought/думал/ you
ought to know."

He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.

There was an uproar. It took/взял/ several purple/пурпурный/ firecrackers exploding from
the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand/палочка/ to bring silence.

"Prefects," he rumbled, "lead your Houses back to the dormitories
immediately!"

Percy was in his element.

"Follow me! Stick/придерживаться/ together, first years! No need to fear/страх/ the troll if
you follow my orders! Stay close behind/за/ me, now. Make way, first years
coming/приход/ through! Excuse me, I'm a prefect!"

"How could a troll get in?" Harry asked as they climbed/поднялся/ the stairs/лестница/.

"Don't ask me, they're supposed/предполагаемый/ to be really stupid," said Ron. "Maybe
Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke."

They passed/прошло/ different groups of people hurrying in different directions.
As they jostled their way through a crowd/толпа/ of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry
suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ grabbed/схватил/ Ron's arm/рука/.

"I've just thought/думал/ -- Hermione."

"What about her?"

"She doesn't know about the troll."

Ron bit his lip.

"Oh, all right," he snapped/щелкнул/. "But Percy'd better not see us."

Ducking down, they joined/присоединился/ the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped/поскользнулся/
down a deserted side corridor/коридор/, and hurried/торопливый/ off toward/к/ the girls'
bathroom. They had just turned/оказалось/ the corner when they heard/услышанным/ quick
footsteps behind/за/ them.

"Percy!" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind/за/ a large stone griffin.

Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the
corridor/коридор/ and disappeared/исчез/ from view.

"What's he doing?" Harry whispered/прошептал/. "Why isn't he down in the dungeons
with the rest/отдых/ of the teachers?"

"Search me."

Quietly/тихо/ as possible, they crept/подкрался/ along/вдоль/ the next corridor/коридор/ after Snape's
fading footsteps.

"He's heading for the third floor," Harry said, but Ron held/Ручной/ up his
hand.

"Can you smell/запах/ something?"

Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached/достиг/ his nostrils, a mixture of old
socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.

And then they heard/услышанным/ it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of
gigantic feet/ноги/. Ron pointed/заостренный/ -- at the end of a passage to the left,
something huge was moving toward/к/ them. They shrank into the shadows and
watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.

It was a horrible/какой ужас/ sight/взгляд/. Twelve feet/ноги/ tall, its skin was a dull, granite
gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head
perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs/ноги/ thick/толстый/ as tree trunks
with flat, horny feet/ноги/. The smell/запах/ coming/приход/ from it was incredible. It was
holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along/вдоль/ the floor because its
arms/оружие/ were so long.

The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its
long ears, making up its tiny/крошечный/ mind/разум/, then slouched slowly into the room.

"The keys in the lock," Harry muttered/пробормотал/. "We could lock it in."

"Good idea," said Ron nervously/нервно/.

They edged toward/к/ the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't
about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed/удалось/ to grab the
key, slam the door, and lock it.

'Yes!"

Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but
as they reached/достиг/ the corner they heard/услышанным/ something that made their hearts
stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming/приход/ from the chamber/камера/
they'd just chained up.

"Oh, no," said Ron, pale/бледный/ as the Bloody Baron.

"It's the girls' bathroom!" Harry gasped/ахнула/.

"Hermione!" they said together.

It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have?
Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned/оказалось/ the key,
fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.

Hermione Granger was shrinking against/против/ the wall opposite, looking as if
she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the
sinks off the walls as it went/отправился/.

"Confuse it!" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he
threw/бросил/ it as hard as he could against/против/ the wall.

The troll stopped a few feet/ноги/ from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking
stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw
Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it
went/отправился/.

"Oy, pea-brain!" yelled/вопил/ Ron from the other side of the chamber/камера/, and he
threw/бросил/ a metal pipe at it. The troll didn't even seem/казаться/ to notice the pipe
hitting its shoulder, but it heard/услышанным/ the yell and paused again, turning/превращение/
its ugly snout toward/к/ Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.

"Come on, run, run!" Harry yelled/вопил/ at Hermione, trying to pull her toward/к/
the door, but she couldn't move, she was still/все еще/ flat against/против/ the wall,
her mouth open with terror.

The shouting and the echoes seemed/казалось/ to be driving the troll berserk. It
roared again and started toward/к/ Ron, who was nearest and had no way to
escape.

Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He
took/взял/ a great running jump and managed/удалось/ to fasten his arms/оружие/ around the
troll's neck/шея/ from behind/за/. The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging/подвешивание/ there,
but even a troll will notice if you stick/придерживаться/ a long bit of wood up its
nose/нос/, and Harry's wand/палочка/ had still/все еще/ been in his hand when he'd jumped -- it
had gone straight/Прямо/ up one of the troll's nostrils.

Howling with pain/боль/, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry
clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him
off or catch/поймать/ him a terrible blow with the club.

Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand/палочка/ --
not knowing/знание/ what he was going to do he heard/услышанным/ himself/сам/ cry the first spell/орфографии/
that came into his head: "Wingardium Leviosa!"

The club flew/полетели/ suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into
the air, turned/оказалось/ slowly over -- and dropped/упал/, with a sickening crack, onto/на/
its owner's head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell/упал/ flat on its
face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.

Harry got to his feet/ноги/. He was shaking/сотрясение/ and out of breath/дыхание/. Ron was
standing/постоянный/ there with his wand/палочка/ still/все еще/ raised/поднятый/, staring/уставившись/ at what he had done.

It was Hermione who spoke/говорил/ first.

"Is it -- dead?"

I don't think so," said Harry, I think it's just been knocked/постучался/ out."

He bent/изогнутый/ down and pulled his wand/палочка/ out of the troll's nose/нос/. It was covered
in what looked like lumpy gray glue.

"Urgh -- troll boogers."

He wiped it on the troll's trousers.

A sudden/внезапный/ slamming and loud/громкий/ footsteps made the three of them look up.
They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course,
someone/кто то/ downstairs must have heard/услышанным/ the crashes and the troll's roars. A
moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room,
closely followed/с последующим/ by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell
took/взял/ one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat/сидел/ quickly
down on a toilet, clutching his heart.

Snape bent/изогнутый/ over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and
Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white.
Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's
mind/разум/.

"What on earth were you thinking of?" said Professor McGonagall, with
cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still/все еще/ standing/постоянный/ with
his wand/палочка/ in the air. "You're lucky/везучий/ you weren't killed. Why aren't you in
your dormitory/общежитие/?"

Snape gave/дал/ Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He
wished Ron would put his wand/палочка/ down.

Then a small voice came out of the shadows.

"Please, Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me."

"Miss Granger!"

Hermione had managed/удалось/ to get to her feet/ноги/ at last.

I went/отправился/ looking for the troll because I -- I thought/думал/ I could deal with it
on my own -- you know, because I've read all about them."

Ron dropped/упал/ his wand/палочка/. Hermione Granger, telling/говоря/ a downright lie to a
teacher? "If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand/палочка/
up its nose/нос/ and Ron knocked/постучался/ it out with its own club. They didn't have
time to come and fetch anyone/кто угодно/. It was about to finish me off when they
arrived."

Harry and Ron tried/пытался/ to look as though/хоть/ this story wasn't new to them.

"Well -- in that case..." said Professor McGonagall, staring/уставившись/ at the
three of them, "Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of
tackling a mountain troll on your own?"

Hermione hung/висела/ her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last
person to do anything against/против/ the rules, and here she was, pretending
she had, to get them out of trouble/беда/. It was as if Snape had started
handing out sweets.

"Miss Granger, five points will be taken/взятый/ from Gryffindor for this," said
Professor McGonagall. "I'm very disappointed in you. If you're not hurt/причинить боль/
at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing
the feast in their houses."

Hermione left.

Professor McGonagall turned/оказалось/ to Harry and Ron.

"Well, I still/все еще/ say you were lucky/везучий/, but not many first years could have
taken/взятый/ on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five
points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go."

They hurried/торопливый/ out of the chamber/камера/ and didn't speak at all until/до/ they had
climbed/поднялся/ two floors up. It was a relief to be away/далеко/ from the smell/запах/ of the
troll, quite/довольно/ apart/Кроме/ from anything else.

"We should have gotten/полученный/ more than ten points," Ron grumbled.

"Five, you mean, once she's taken/взятый/ off Hermione's."

"Good of her to get us out of trouble/беда/ like that," Ron admitted. "Mind/разум/
you, we did save her."

"She might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked/запертый/ the thing in with
her," Harry reminded/напомнил/ him.

They had reached/достиг/ the portrait of the Fat Lady.

"Pig snout," they said and entered.

The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that
had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood/стоял/ alone/в одиночестве/ by the door, waiting
for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none/никто/ of them looking
at each other, they all said "Thanks," and hurried/торопливый/ off to get plates.

But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became/стал/ their friend. There are
some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and
knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.


CHAPTER ELEVEN

QUIDDITCH

As they entered November, the weather turned/оказалось/ very cold. The mountains
around the school became/стал/ icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every
morning the ground/земля/ was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the
upstairs/вверх по лестнице/ windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled
up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous
beaverskin boots.

The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in
his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If
Gryffindor won/выиграл/, they would move up into second place in the house
championship.

Hardly anyone/кто угодно/ had seen Harry play because Wood had decided/приняли решение/ that, as
their secret weapon, Harry should be kept/держали/, well, secret. But the news
that he was playing Seeker/искатель/ had leaked out somehow/как-то/, and Harry didn't know
which was worse/хуже/ -- people telling/говоря/ him he'd be brilliant or people
telling/говоря/ him they'd be running around underneath/под/ him holding a mattress.

It was really lucky/везучий/ that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend. He didn't
know how he'd have gotten/полученный/ through all his homework without her, what
with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She
had also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned/оказалось/ out to be a
very interesting read.

Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a
Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during/в течение/ a World Cup
match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest
players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed/казалось/ to happen to
them; that although/несмотря на то что/ people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had
been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.

Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry
and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer
for it. The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them
were out in the freezing courtyard during/в течение/ break, and she had conjured
them up a bright/яркий/ blue fire that could be carried/осуществляется/ around in a jam jar.
They were standing/постоянный/ with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape
crossed the yard. Harry noticed/заметил/ at once that Snape was limping. Harry,
Ron, and Hermione moved closer/ближе/ together to block the fire from view;
they were sure it wouldn't be allowed. Unfortunately, something about
their guilty faces caught/пойманный/ Snape's eye. He limped over. He hadn't seen
the fire, but he seemed/казалось/ to be looking for a reason to tell them off
anyway/так или иначе/.

"What's that you've got there, Potter?"

It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.

"Library books are not to be taken/взятый/ outside the school," said Snape.
"Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor."

"He's just made that rule up," Harry muttered/пробормотал/ angrily as Snape limped
away/далеко/. "Wonder/задаваться вопросом/ what's wrong/неправильно/ with his leg/нога/?"

"Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him," said Ron bitterly.

The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione sat/сидел/ together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and
Ron's Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy ("How will
you learn?"), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right
answers anyway/так или иначе/.

Harry felt/почувствовал/ restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take
his mind/разум/ off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of
Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if
he could have it.

"Better you than me," they said together, but Harry had an idea that
Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening.

He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked/постучался/. There was no answer.
He knocked/постучался/ again. Nothing.

Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed
the door ajar and peered inside -- and a horrible/какой ужас/ scene met his eyes.

Snape and Filch/стащить/ were inside, alone/в одиночестве/. Snape was holding his robes/робы/ above/выше/
his knees/колени/. One of his legs/ноги/ was bloody and mangled. Filch/стащить/ was handing
Snape bandages.

"Blasted thing*," Snape was saying. "How are you supposed/предполагаемый/ to keep your
eyes on all three heads/руководители/ at once?"

Harry tried/пытался/ to shut/закрыть/ the door quietly/тихо/, but --

"POTTER!"

Snape's face was twisted with fury as he dropped/упал/ his robes/робы/ quickly to
hide his leg/нога/. Harry gulped.

"I just wondered/задавались вопросом/ if I could have my book back."

"GET OUT! OUT!"

Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He
sprinted back upstairs/вверх по лестнице/.

"Did you get it?" Ron asked as Harry joined/присоединился/ them. "What's the matter/дело/?"

In a low whisper, Harry told them what he'd seen.

"You know what this means?" he finished breathlessly. "He tried/пытался/ to get
past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That's where he was going when
we saw him -- he's after whatever/без разницы/ it's guarding/охранные/! And Id bet/делать ставку/ my
broomstick/метловище/ he let that troll in, to make a diversion!"

Hermione's eyes were wide/широкий/.

"No -- he wouldn't, she said. "I know he's not very nice, but he
wouldn't try and steal/украсть/ something Dumbledore was keeping/хранение/ safe."

"Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,"
snapped/щелкнул/ Ron. "I'm with Harry. I wouldn't put anything past Snape. But
what's he after? What's that dog guarding/охранные/?"

Harry went/отправился/ to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville
was snoring loudly/громко/, but Harry couldn't sleep. He tried/пытался/ to empty his mind/разум/
-- he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a
few hours -- but the expression on Snape's face when Harry had seen his
leg/нога/ wasn't easy to forget/забывать/.

The next morning dawned very bright/яркий/ and cold. The Great Hall was full of
the delicious smell/запах/ of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of
everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.

"You've got to eat some breakfast."

"I don't want anything."

"Just a bit of toast," wheedled Hermione.

"I'm not hungry."

Harry felt/почувствовал/ terrible. In an hour's time he'd be walking onto/на/ the field.

"Harry, you need your strength," said Seamus/Симус/ Finnigan. "Seekers are
always the ones/те,/ who get clobbered by the other team."

"Thanks, Seamus/Симус/," said Harry, watching Seamus/Симус/ pile/свая/ ketchup on his
sausages.

By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed/казалось/ to be out in the stands around
the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be
raised/поднятый/ high in the air, but it was still/все еще/ difficult to see what was going
on sometimes.

Ron and Hermione joined/присоединился/ Neville, Seamus/Симус/, and Dean the West Ham fan up in
the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on
one of the sheets Scabbers/Scabbers/ had ruined. It said Potter for President, and
Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion
underneath/под/. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that
the paint flashed different colors.

Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest/отдых/ of the team were
changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes/робы/ (Slytherin would be playing
in green).

Wood cleared his throat for silence.

"Okay, men," he said.

"And women," said Chaser Angelina Johnson.

"And women," Wood agreed/согласовано/. "This is it."

"The big one," said Fred Weasley/Уизли/.

"The one we've all been waiting for," said George.

"We know Oliver's speech by heart," Fred told Harry, "we were on the
team last year."

"Shut/закрыть/ up, you two," said Wood. "This is the best team Gryffindor's had
in years. We're going to win. I know it."

He glared at them all as if to say, "Or else."

"Right. It's time. Good luck, all of you."

Harry followed/с последующим/ Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping/надеясь/ his
knees/колени/ weren't going to give way, walked onto/на/ the field to loud/громкий/ cheers.

Madam Hooch/самогон/ was refereeing. She stood/стоял/ in the middle of the field waiting
for the two teams, her broom/метла/ in her hand.

"Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you," she said, once they were all
gathered around her. Harry noticed/заметил/ that she seemed/казалось/ to be speaking
particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint/кремень/, a sixth year. Harry
thought/думал/ Flint/кремень/ looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the
corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above/выше/, flashing
Potter for President over the crowd/толпа/. His heart skipped. He felt/почувствовал/ braver.

"Mount your brooms/веники/, please."

Harry clambered onto/на/ his Nimbus/нимб/ Two Thousand.

Madam Hooch/самогон/ gave/дал/ a loud/громкий/ blast on her silver whistle.

Fifteen brooms/веники/ rose up, high, high into the air. They were off. "And the
Quaffle/Кваффл/ is taken/взятый/ immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor -- what
an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather/скорее/ attractive, too --"

"JORDAN!"

"Sorry, Professor."

The Weasley/Уизли/ twins/двойняшки/' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the
match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.

"And she's really belting along/вдоль/ up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet,
a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve -- back to
Johnson and -- no, the Slytherins have taken/взятый/ the Quaffle/Кваффл/, Slytherin
Captain Marcus Flint/кремень/ gains the Quaffle/Кваффл/ and off he goes/идет/ -- Flint/кремень/ flying
like an eagle up there -- he's going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent
move by Gryffindor Keeper/хранитель/ Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle/Кваффл/ --
that's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint/кремень/,
off up the field and -- OUCH -- that must have hurt/причинить боль/, hit in the back of
the head by a Bludger -- Quaffle/Кваффл/ taken/взятый/ by the Slytherins -- that's
Adrian Pucey speeding off toward/к/ the goal posts, but he's blocked by a
second Bludger -- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley/Уизли/, can't tell
which -- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway/так или иначе/, and Johnson back in
possession of the Quaffle/Кваффл/, a clear field ahead/впереди/ and off she goes/идет/ -- she's
really flying -- dodges a speeding Bludger -- the goal posts are ahead/впереди/
-- come on, now, Angelina -- Keeper/хранитель/ Bletchley dives -- misses --
GRYFFINDORS SCORE!"

Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the
Slytherins.

"Budge up there, move along/вдоль/."

"Hagrid!"

Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough/достаточно/ space to join
them.

"Bin/бункер/ watchin' from me hut/хижина/," said Hagrid, patting a large pair of
binoculars around his neck/шея/, "But it isn't the same as bein' in the
crowd/толпа/. No sign of the Snitch/доносчик/ yet, eh?"

"Nope," said Ron. "Harry hasn't had much to do yet."

"Kept/держали/ outta/убираться/ trouble/беда/, though/хоть/, that's somethin'," said Hagrid, raising his
binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.

Way up above/выше/ them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for
some sign of the Snitch/доносчик/. This was part of his and Wood's game plan.

"Keep out of the way until/до/ you catch/поймать/ sight/взгляд/ of the Snitch/доносчик/," Wood had
said. "We don't want you attacked before you have to be."

When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to
let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring/уставившись/ around for the Snitch/доносчик/.
Once he caught/пойманный/ sight/взгляд/ of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection
from one of the Weasleys/Уизли/' wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided/приняли решение/ to
come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry
dodged it and Fred Weasley/Уизли/ came chasing after it.

"All right there, Harry?" he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger
furiously/бешено/ toward/к/ Marcus Flint/кремень/.

"Slytherin in possession," Lee Jordan was saying, "Chaser Pucey ducks
two Bludgers/бладжеры/, two Weasleys/Уизли/, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward/к/ the --
wait a moment -- was that the Snitch/доносчик/?"

A murmur ran through the crowd/толпа/ as Adrian Pucey dropped/упал/ the Quaffle/Кваффл/, too
busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed/прошло/ his
left ear.

Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the
streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker/искатель/ Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck/шея/
and neck/шея/ they hurtled toward/к/ the Snitch/доносчик/ -all the Chasers seemed/казалось/ to have
forgotten/забытый/ what they were supposed/предполагаемый/ to be doing as they hung/висела/ in midair to
watch.

Harry was faster than Higgs -- he could see the little round ball, wings
fluttering, darting up ahead/впереди/ - - he put on an extra spurt of speed --

WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus Flint/кремень/
had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry's broom/метла/ spun off course, Harry
holding on for dear life.

"Foul!" screamed/кричал/ the Gryffindors.

Madam Hooch/самогон/ spoke/говорил/ angrily to Flint/кремень/ and then ordered a free shot at the
goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the
Golden Snitch/доносчик/ had disappeared/исчез/ from sight/взгляд/ again.

Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, "Send him off, ref! Red
card!"

"What are you talking about, Dean?" said Ron.

"Red card!" said Dean furiously/бешено/. "In soccer you get shown the red card
and you're out of the game!"

"But this isn't soccer, Dean," Ron reminded/напомнил/ him.

Hagrid, however, was on Dean's side.

"They oughta change the rules. Flint/кремень/ coulda knocked/постучался/ Harry outta/убираться/ the
air."

Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.

"So -- after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating

"Jordan!" growled Professor McGonagall.

"I mean, after that open and revolting foul

'Jordan, I'm warning you --"

"All right, all right. Flint/кремень/ nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker/искатель/, which
could happen to anyone/кто угодно/, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken/взятый/ by
Spinner, who puts it away/далеко/, no trouble/беда/, and we continue play, Gryffindor
still/все еще/ in possession."

It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went/отправился/ spinning dangerously
past his head, that it happened. His broom/метла/ gave/дал/ a sudden/внезапный/, frightening
lurch. For a split second, he thought/думал/ he was going to fall/падать/. He gripped
the broom/метла/ tightly with both his hands and knees/колени/. He'd never felt/почувствовал/
anything like that.

It happened again. It was as though/хоть/ the broom/метла/ was trying to buck him
off. But Nimbus/нимб/ Two Thousands did not suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ decide to buck their
riders off. Harry tried/пытался/ to turn back toward/к/ the Gryffindor goal- posts
-- he had half a mind/разум/ to ask Wood to call time-out -- and then he
realized that his broom/метла/ was completely out of his control. He couldn't
turn it. He couldn't direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the
air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that
almost/почти/ unseated him.

Lee was still/все еще/ commentating.

"Slytherin in possession -- Flint/кремень/ with the Quaffle/Кваффл/ -- passes Spinnet --
passes Bell -- hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose/нос/
-- only joking, Professor -- Slytherins score -- A no...

The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed/казалось/ to have noticed/заметил/ that Harry's
broom/метла/ was behaving strangely. It was carrying/проведение/- him slowly higher, away/далеко/
from the game, jerking and twitching as it went/отправился/.

"Dunno what Harry thinks he's doing," Hagrid mumbled. He stared through
his binoculars. "If I didn' know better, I'd say he'd lost control of
his broom/метла/... but he can't have...."

Suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/, people were pointing/указательный/ up at Harry all over the stands. His
broom/метла/ had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to
hold on. Then the whole crowd/толпа/ gasped/ахнула/. Harry's broom/метла/ had given a wild
jerk and Harry swung/качнулся/ off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on
with only one hand.

"Did something happen to it when Flint/кремень/ blocked him?" Seamus/Симус/ whispered/прошептал/.

"Can't have," Hagrid said, his voice shaking/сотрясение/. "Can't nothing interfere
with a broomstick/метловище/ except/Кроме/ powerful Dark magic -- no kid could do that to
a Nimbus/нимб/ Two Thousand."

At these/эти/ words, Hermione seized/захватили/ Hagrid's binoculars, but instead of
looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd/толпа/.

"What are you doing?" moaned Ron, gray-faced.

"I knew it," Hermione gasped/ахнула/, "Snape -- look."

Ron grabbed/схватил/ the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands
opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop
under his breath/дыхание/.

"He's doing something -- jinxing the broom/метла/," said Hermione.

"What should we do?"

"Leave it to me."

Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared/исчез/. Ron turned/оказалось/
the binoculars back on Harry. His broom/метла/ was vibrating so hard, it was
almost/почти/ impossible for him to hang/вешать/ on much longer. The whole crowd/толпа/ was on
its feet/ноги/, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys/Уизли/ flew/полетели/ up to try and pull
Harry safely onto/на/ one of their brooms/веники/, but it was no good -- every time
they got near him, the broom/метла/ would jump higher still/все еще/. They dropped/упал/ lower
and circled beneath him, obviously/очевидно/ hoping/надеясь/ to catch/поймать/ him if he fell/упал/.
Marcus

Flint/кремень/ seized/захватили/ the Quaffle/Кваффл/ and scored five times without anyone/кто угодно/ noticing.

"Come on, Hermione," Ron muttered/пробормотал/ desperately.

Hermione had fought her way across/через/ to the stand/стоять/ where Snape stood/стоял/, and
was now racing along/вдоль/ the row behind/за/ him; she didn't even stop to say
sorry as she knocked/постучался/ Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front.
Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand/палочка/, and whispered/прошептал/ a
few, well- chosen words. Bright/яркий/ blue flames shot from her wand/палочка/ onto/на/ the
hem of Snape's robes/робы/.

It took/взял/ perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire.
A sudden/внезапный/ yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him
into a little jar in her pocket/карман/, she scrambled back along/вдоль/ the row --
Snape would never know what had happened.

It was enough/достаточно/. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ able/в состоянии/ to clamber back on
to his broom/метла/.

"Neville, you can look!" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into
Hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes.

Harry was speeding toward/к/ the ground/земля/ when the crowd/толпа/ saw him clap his
hand to his mouth as though/хоть/ he was about to be sick -- he hit the field
on all fours -- coughed -- and something gold fell/упал/ into his hand.

"I've got the Snitch/доносчик/!" he shouted/кричал/, waving it above/выше/ his head, and the
game ended in complete confusion.

"He didn't catch/поймать/ it, he nearly swallowed it," Flint/кремень/ was still/все еще/ howling
twenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- Harry hadn't broken
any rules and Lee Jordan was still/все еще/ happily shouting the results --
Gryffindor had won/выиграл/ by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry
heard/услышанным/ none/никто/ of this, though/хоть/. He was being/являющийся/ made a cup of strong tea back
in Hagrid's hut/хижина/, with Ron and Hermione.

"It was Snape," Ron was explaining, "Hermione and I saw him. He was
cursing your broomstick/метловище/, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you."

"Rubbish," said Hagrid, who hadn't heard/услышанным/ a word of what had gone on next
to him in the stands. "Why would Snape do somethin' like that?"

Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering/интересно/ what to tell
him. Harry decided/приняли решение/ on the truth.

"I found out something about him," he told Hagrid. "He tried/пытался/ to get past
that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying
to steal/украсть/ whatever/без разницы/ it's guarding/охранные/."

Hagrid dropped/упал/ the teapot.

"How do you know about Fluffy/пушистый/?" he said.

"Fluffy/пушистый/?"

"Yeah -- he's mine -- bought/купил/ him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub
las' year -- I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the

"Yes?" said Harry eagerly.

"Now, don't ask me anymore," said Hagrid gruffly. "That's top secret,
that is."

"But Snape's trying to steal/украсть/ it."

"Rubbish," said Hagrid again. "Snape's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do
nothin' of the sort."

"So why did he just try and kill Harry?" cried Hermione.

The afternoon's events certainly seemed/казалось/ to have changed her mind/разум/ about
Snape.

I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them!

You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all, I saw
him!"

"I'm tellin' yeh, yer/Ер/ wrong/неправильно/!" said Hagrid hotly. "I don' know why
Harry's broom/метла/ acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student!
Now, listen to me, all three of yeh -- yer/Ер/ meddlin' in things that don'
concern yeh. It's dangerous. You forget/забывать/ that dog, an' you forget/забывать/ what
it's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel/Фламель/
--"

"Aha!" said Harry, "so there's someone/кто то/ called Nicolas Flamel/Фламель/ involved,
is there?"

Hagrid looked furious with himself/сам/.


CHAPTER TWELVE

THE MIRROR OF ERISED

Christmas was coming/приход/. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke/просыпался/ to find
itself covered in several feet/ноги/ of snow. The lake froze solid and the
Weasley/Уизли/ twins/двойняшки/ were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that
they followed/с последующим/ Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The
few owls/совы/ that managed/удалось/ to battle their way through the stormy sky to
deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could
fly off again.

No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common
room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had
become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms.
Worst of all were Professor Snape's classes down in the dungeons, where
their breath/дыхание/ rose in a mist before them and they kept/держали/ as close as
possible to their hot cauldrons.

"I do feel so sorry," said Draco Malfoy, one Potions/зелий/ class, "for all
those/те/ people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're
not wanted at home."

He was looking over at Harry as he spoke/говорил/. Crabbe/Крэбб/ and Goyle chuckled.
Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them.
Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch
match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried/пытался/ to get
everyone laughing at how a wide/широкий/-mouthed tree frog would be replacing
Harry as Seeker/искатель/ next. Then he'd realized that nobody found this funny,
because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed/удалось/ to stay
on his bucking broomstick/метловище/. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back
to taunting Harry about having no proper family.

It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet/бирючина/ Drive for Christmas.
Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of
students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up
at once. He didn't feel sorry for himself/сам/ at all; this would probably/вероятно/ be
the best Christmas he'd ever/Когда-либо/ had. Ron and his brothers were staying,
too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley/Уизли/ were going to Romania to visit
Charlie.

When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions/зелий/, they found a large
fir tree blocking the corridor/коридор/ ahead/впереди/. Two enormous feet/ноги/ sticking out at
the bottom and a loud/громкий/ puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind/за/ it.

"Hi, Hagrid, want any help?" Ron asked, sticking his head through the
branches.

"Nah, I'm all right, thanks, Ron."

"Would you mind/разум/ moving out of the way?" came Malfoys cold drawl from
behind/за/ them. "Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley/Уизли/? Hoping/надеясь/
to be gamekeeper yourself/сам/ when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose/предполагать/ -- that hut/хижина/
of Hagrid's must seem/казаться/ like a palace compared to what your family's used
to."

Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs/лестница/.

"WEASLEY/Уизли/!"

Ron let go of the front of Malfoy's robes/робы/.

"He was provoked, Professor Snape," said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy
face out from behind/за/ the tree. "Malfoy was insultin' his family."

"Be that as it may, fighting is against/против/ Hogwarts rules, Hagrid," said
Snape silkily. "Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley/Уизли/, and be grateful it
isn't more. Move along/вдоль/, all of you."

Malfoy, Crabbe/Крэбб/, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering
needles everywhere and smirking.

"I'll get him," said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, "one of
these/эти/ days, I'll get him --"

"I hate them both," said Harry, "Malfoy and Snape."

"Come on, cheer up, it's nearly Christmas," said Hagrid. "Tell yeh what,
come with me an' see the Great Hall, looks a treat."

So the three of them followed/с последующим/ Hagrid and his tree off to -the Great
Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with
the Christmas decorations.

"Ah, Hagrid, the last tree -- put it in the far corner, would you?"

The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung/висела/ all
around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood/стоял/
around the room, some sparkling with tiny/крошечный/ icicles, some glittering with
hundreds of candles.

"How many days you got left until/до/ yer/Ер/ holidays?" Hagrid asked.

"Just one," said Hermione. "And that reminds me -Harry, Ron, we've got
half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library."

"Oh yeah, you're right," said Ron, tearing his eyes away/далеко/ from Professor
Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand/палочка/ and was
trailing them over the branches of the new tree.

"The library?" said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. "Just before
the holidays? Bit keen, aren't yeh?"

"Oh, we're not working," Harry told him brightly. "Ever/Когда-либо/ since you
mentioned Nicolas Flamel/Фламель/ we've been trying to find out who he is."

"You what?" Hagrid looked shocked. "Listen here -- I've told yeh -- drop
it. It's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'."

"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel/Фламель/ is, that's all," said Hermione.

"Unless/если/ you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble/беда/?" Harry added. "We
must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him
anywhere -- just give us a hint -- I know I've read his name somewhere/где-то/."

"I'm sayin' nothin, said Hagrid flatly.

"Just have to find out for ourselves, then," said Ron, and they left
Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried/торопливый/ off to the library.

They had indeed/в самом деле/ been searching books for Flamel/Фламель/'s name ever/Когда-либо/ since Hagrid
had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape
was trying to steal/украсть/? The trouble/беда/ was, it was very hard to know where to
begin, not knowing/знание/ what Flamel/Фламель/ might have done to get himself/сам/ into a
book. He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable
Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern
Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And
then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of
thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.

Hermione took/взял/ out a list of subjects and titles she had decided/приняли решение/ to
search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them
off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted
Section. He had been wondering/интересно/ for a while if Flamel/Фламель/ wasn't somewhere/где-то/ in
there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note/заметка/ from one of the
teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never
get one. These/эти/ were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never
taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced
Defense Against/против/ the Dark Arts.

"What are you looking for, boy?"

"Nothing," said Harry.

Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.

"You'd better get out, then. Go on -- out!"

Wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left
the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed/согласовано/ they'd better not
ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel/Фламель/. They were sure she'd be
able/в состоянии/ to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were
up to.

Harry waited outside in the corridor/коридор/ to see if the other two had found
anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two
weeks, after A, but as they only had odd/странный/ moments between lessons it
wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a
nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.

Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined/присоединился/ him, shaking/сотрясение/ their heads/руководители/.
They went/отправился/ off to lunch.

"You will keep looking while I'm away/далеко/, won/выиграл/'t you?" said Hermione. "And
send me an owl/сова/ if you find anything."

"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel/Фламель/ is," said Ron.
"It'd be safe to ask them."

"Very safe, as they're both dentists," said Hermione.

Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time
to think much about Flamel/Фламель/. They had the dormitory/общежитие/ to themselves/самих себя/ and the
common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able/в состоянии/ to get the
good armchairs by the fire. They sat/сидел/ by the hour eating anything they
could spear on a toasting fork -- bread, English muffins, marshmallows
-- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled/исключенный/, which were fun to talk
about even if they wouldn't work.

Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly/в точку/ like
Muggle chess except/Кроме/ that the figures were alive, which made it a lot
like directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered.
Like everything/все/ else he owned, it had once belonged to someone/кто то/ else in
his family -- in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen
weren't a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble/беда/
getting them to do what he wanted.

Harry played with chessmen Seamus/Симус/ Finnigan had lent him, and they didn't
trust him at all. He wasn't a very good player yet and they kept/держали/
shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. "Don't
send me there, can't you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose/потерять/
him." On Christmas Eve, Harry went/отправился/ to bed looking forward to the next
day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all.
When he woke/просыпался/ early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a
small pile/свая/ of packages at the foot of his bed.

"Merry Christmas," said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and
pulled on his bathrobe.

"You, too," said Harry. "Will you look at this? I've got some presents!"

"What did you expect, turnips?" said Ron, turning/превращение/ to his own pile/свая/, which
was a lot bigger than Harry's.

Harry picked/выбрал/ up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick/толстый/ brown paper and
scrawled across/через/ it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut
wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously/очевидно/ whittled it himself/сам/. Harry blew it --
it sounded a bit like an owl/сова/.

A second, very small parcel contained a note/заметка/.

We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle
Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note/заметка/ was a fifty-pence piece.

"That's friendly," said Harry.

Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.

"Weird!" he said, 'NMat a shape! This is money?"

"You can keep it," said Harry, laughing at how pleased/довольный/ Ron was. "Hagrid
and my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these/эти/?"

"I think I know who that one's from," said Ron, turning/превращение/ a bit pink and
pointing/указательный/ to a very lumpy parcel. "My mom. I told her you didn't expect
any presents and -- oh, no," he groaned, "she's made you a Weasley/Уизли/
sweater/свитер/."

Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick/толстый/, hand-knitted sweater/свитер/ in
emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.

"Every year she makes us a sweater/свитер/," said Ron, unwrapping his own, "and
mine's always maroon."

"That's really nice of her," said Harry, trying the fudge, which was
very tasty.

His next present also contained candy -- a large box of Chocolate Frogs
from Hermione.

This only left one parcel. Harry picked/выбрал/ it up and felt/почувствовал/ it. It was very
light. He unwrapped it.

Something fluid and silvery gray went/отправился/ slithering to the floor where it
lay/прокладывать/ in gleaming folds. Ron gasped/ахнула/.

"I've heard/услышанным/ of those/те/," he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of
Every Flavor Beans he'd gotten/полученный/ from Hermione. "If that's what I think it
is -- they're really rare, and really valuable."

"What is it?"

Harry picked/выбрал/ the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange/странный/ to
the touch, like water woven into material.

"It's an invisibility cloak," said Ron, a look of awe on his face. "I'm
sure it is -- try it on."

Harry threw/бросил/ the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave/дал/ a yell.

"It is! Look down!"

Harry looked down at his feet/ноги/, but they were gone. He dashed to the
mirror. Sure enough/достаточно/, his reflection looked back at him, just his head
suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak
over his head and his reflection vanished completely.

"There's a note/заметка/!" said Ron suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/. "A note/заметка/ fell/упал/ out of it!"

Harry pulled off the cloak and seized/захватили/ the letter. Written in narrow,
loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your
father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was
returned to you. Use it well.

A Very Merry Christmas to you.


There was no signature. Harry stared at the note/заметка/. Ron was admiring the
cloak.

"I'd give anything for one of these/эти/," he said. "Anything. What's the
matter/дело/?"

"Nothing," said Harry. He felt/почувствовал/ very strange/странный/. Who had sent the cloak? Had
it really once belonged to his father?

Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory/общежитие/ door was flung
open and Fred and George Weasley/Уизли/ bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak
quickly out of sight/взгляд/. He didn't feel like sharing it with anyone/кто угодно/ else
yet.

"Merry Christmas!"

"Hey, look -- Harry's got a Weasley/Уизли/ sweater/свитер/, too!"

Fred and George were wearing/носить/ blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on
it, the other a G.

"Harry's is better than ours, though/хоть/," said Fred, holding up Harry's
sweater/свитер/. "She obviously/очевидно/ makes more of an effort if you're not family."

"Why aren't you wearing/носить/ yours, Ron?" George demanded. "Come on, get it
on, they're lovely and warm."

"I hate maroon," Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.

"You haven't got a letter on yours," George observed. "I suppose/предполагать/ she
thinks you don't forget/забывать/ your name. But we're not stupid -- we know we're
called Gred and Forge."

"What's all th is noise.

Percy Weasley/Уизли/ stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He
had clearly gotten/полученный/ halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too,
carried/осуществляется/ a lumpy sweater/свитер/ over his arm/рука/, which

Fred seized/захватили/.

"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing/носить/ ours, even
Harry got one."

"I -- don't -- want said Percy thickly, as the twins/двойняшки/ forced the sweater/свитер/
over his head, knocking his glasses askew.

"And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either/или/," said

George. "Christmas is a time for family."

They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms/оружие/ pinned to his side by
his sweater/свитер/.

Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred
fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of
chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick/толстый/, rich gravy
and cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet/ноги/
along/вдоль/ the table. These/эти/ fantastic party favors were nothing like the
feeble Muggle ones/те,/ the Dursleys usually bought/купил/, with their little
plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard
cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went/отправился/ off with a blast like
a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the
inside exploded a rear admiral's hat/шапка/ and several live, white mice. Up at
the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed/заостренный/ wizard's hat/шапка/ for a
flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick
had just read him.

Flaming Christmas puddings followed/с последующим/ the turkey. Percy nearly broke his
teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid
getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine,
finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's
amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat/шапка/ lopsided.

When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of
things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous
balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set.
The white mice had disappeared/исчез/ and Harry had a nasty/противный/ feeling they were
going to end up as Mrs. Norris/Norris/'s Christmas dinner.

Harry and the Weasleys/Уизли/ spent/потраченный/ a happy afternoon having a furious snowball
fight on the grounds/основания/. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath/дыхание/, they
returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in
his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he
wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried/пытался/ to help him so much.

After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake,
everyone felt/почувствовал/ too full and sleepy to do much before bed except/Кроме/ sit and
watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because
they'd stolen his prefect badge.

It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever/Когда-либо/. Yet something had been
nagging at the back of his mind/разум/ all day. Not until/до/ he climbed/поднялся/ into bed
was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had
sent it.

Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him,
fell/упал/ asleep/спящий/ almost/почти/ as soon/скоро/ as he'd drawn the curtains of his
four-poster. Harry leaned/подался/ over the side of his own bed and pulled the
cloak out from under it.

His father's... this had been his father's. He let the material flow
over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note/заметка/
had said.

He had to try it, now. He slipped/поскользнулся/ out of bed and wrapped the cloak
around himself/сам/. Looking down at his legs/ноги/, he saw only moonlight and
shadows. It was a very funny feeling.

Use it well.

Suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/, Harry felt/почувствовал/ wide/широкий/-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him
in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood/стоял/ there in the
dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch/стащить/
would never know.

Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held/Ручной/ him back
-- his father's cloak -- he felt/почувствовал/ that this time -- the first time -- he
wanted to use it alone/в одиночестве/.

He crept/подкрался/ out of the dormitory/общежитие/, down the stairs/лестница/, across/через/ the common room,
and climbed/поднялся/ through the portrait hole.

"Who's there?" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked
quickly down the corridor/коридор/.

Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought/думал/. And then
it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He'd be able/в состоянии/ to
read as long as he liked, as long as it took/взял/ to find out who Flamel/Фламель/ was.
He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he
walked.

The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his
way along/вдоль/ the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along/вдоль/
in midair, and even though/хоть/ Harry could feel his arm/рука/ supporting it, the
sight/взгляд/ gave/дал/ him the creeps.

The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Step ping
carefully over the rope that separated these/эти/ books from the rest/отдых/ of the
library, he held/Ручной/ up his lamp to read the titles.

They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled
words in languages Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title at all.
One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The
hairs on the back of Harry's neck/шея/ prickled. Maybe he was imagining it,
maybe not, but he thought/думал/ a faint whispering was coming/приход/ from the books,
as though/хоть/ they knew someone/кто то/ was there who shouldn't be.

He had to start somewhere/где-то/. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor,
he looked along/вдоль/ the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A large
black and silver volume caught/пойманный/ his eye. He pulled it out with
difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee,
let it fall/падать/ open.

A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was
screaming! Harry snapped/щелкнул/ it shut/закрыть/, but the shriek went/отправился/ on and on, one
high, unbroken, earsplitting note/заметка/. He stumbled backward and knocked/постучался/ over
his lamp, which went/отправился/ out at once. Panicking, he heard/услышанным/ footsteps coming/приход/
down the corridor/коридор/ outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the
shelf, he ran for it. He passed/прошло/ Filch/стащить/ in the doorway; Filch/стащить/'s pale/бледный/, wild
eyes looked straight/Прямо/ through him, and Harry slipped/поскользнулся/ under Filch/стащить/'s
outstretched arm/рука/ and streaked off up the corridor/коридор/, the book's shrieks
still/все еще/ ringing in his ears.

He came to a sudden/внезапный/ halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been
so busy getting away/далеко/ from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where
he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he
was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he
must be five floors above/выше/ there.

"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone/кто угодно/ was
wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted
Section."

Harry felt/почувствовал/ the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch/стащить/ must
know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer/ближе/, and
to his horror/ужастик/, it was Snape who replied, "The Restricted Section? Well,
they can't be far, we'll catch/поймать/ them."

Harry stood/стоял/ rooted to the spot as Filch/стащить/ and Snape came around the corner
ahead/впереди/. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor/коридор/
and if they came much nearer/ближе/ they'd knock right into him -- the cloak
didn't stop him from being/являющийся/ solid.

He backed away/далеко/ as quietly/тихо/ as he could. A door stood/стоял/ ajar to his left. It
was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath/дыхание/, trying
not to move it, and to his relief he managed/удалось/ to get inside the room
without their noticing anything. They walked straight/Прямо/ past, and Harry
leaned/подался/ against/против/ the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps
dying away/далеко/. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before
he noticed/заметил/ anything about the room he had hidden in.

It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs
were piled against/против/ the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper
basket -- but propped against/против/ the wall facing him was something that
didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone/кто то/
had just put it there to keep it out of the way.

It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling/потолок/, with an ornate gold
frame, standing/постоянный/ on two clawed feet/ноги/. There was an inscription carved
around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic
fading now that there was no sound of Filch/стащить/ and Snape, Harry moved
nearer/ближе/ to the mirror, wanting to look at himself/сам/ but see no reflection
again. He stepped/ступенчатый/ in front of it.

He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself/сам/ from screaming. He
whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously/бешено/ than when the
book had screamed/кричал/ -- for he had seen not only himself/сам/ in the mirror, but
a whole crowd/толпа/ of people standing/постоянный/ right behind/за/ him.

But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned/оказалось/ slowly back to
the mirror.

There he was, reflected in it, white and scared/испуганный/-looking, and there,
reflected behind/за/ him, were at least/наименее/ ten others. Harry looked over his
shoulder -- but still/все еще/, no one was there. Or were they all invisible,
too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's
trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?

He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing/постоянный/ right behind/за/ his
reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached/достиг/ out a hand and felt/почувствовал/
the air behind/за/ him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their
reflections were so close together, but he felt/почувствовал/ only air -- she and the
others existed only in the mirror.

She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her
eyes are just like mine, Harry thought/думал/, edging a little closer/ближе/ to the
glass. Bright/яркий/ green -- exactly/в точку/ the same shape, but then he noticed/заметил/ that
she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin/тонкий/,
black-haired man standing/постоянный/ next to her put his arm/рука/ around her. He wore
glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as
Harry's did.

Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose/нос/ was nearly touching
that of his reflection.

"Mom?" he whispered/прошептал/. "Dad?"

They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the
faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green
eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as
though/хоть/ he had Harry's knobbly knees/колени/ -- Harry was looking at his family,
for the first time in his life.

The Potters smiled and waved/махал/ at Harry and he stared hungrily back at
them, his hands pressed flat against/против/ the glass as though/хоть/ he was hoping/надеясь/
to fall/падать/ right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache
inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.

How long he stood/стоял/ there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade
and he looked and looked until/до/ a distant noise brought/привел/ him back to his
senses. He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He
tore his eyes away/далеко/ from his mother's face, whispered/прошептал/, "I'll come back,"
and hurried/торопливый/ from the room.

"You could have woken me up," said Ron, crossly.

"You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror.

"I'd like to see your mom and dad," Ron said eagerly.

"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys/Уизли/, you'll be able/в состоянии/ to
show me your other brothers and everyone."

"You can see them any old time," said Ron. "Just come round my house
this summer. Anyway/так или иначе/, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not
finding Flamel/Фламель/, though/хоть/. Have some bacon or something, why aren't you
eating anything?"

Harry couldn't eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them
again tonight. He had almost/почти/ forgotten/забытый/ about Flamel/Фламель/. It didn't seem/казаться/ very
important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding/охранные/?
What did it matter/дело/ if Snape stole it, really?

"Are you all right?" said Ron. "You look odd/странный/."

What Harry feared most was that he might not be able/в состоянии/ to find the mirror
room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much
more slowly the next night. They tried/пытался/ retracing Harry's route from the
library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.

"I'm freezing," said Ron. "Let's forget/забывать/ it and go back."

"No!" Harry hissed. I know it's here somewhere/где-то/."

They passed/прошло/ the ghost/призрак/ of a tall witch/ведьма/ gliding in the opposite direction,
but saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet/ноги/ were dead
with cold, Harry spotted/пятнистый/ the suit of armor.

"It's here -- just here -- yes!"

They pushed the door open. Harry dropped/упал/ the cloak from around his
shoulders and ran to the mirror.

There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight/взгляд/ of him.

"See?" Harry whispered/прошептал/.

"I can't see anything."

"Look! Look at them all... there are loads of them...."

"I can only see you."

"Look in it properly, go on, stand/стоять/ where I am."

Harry stepped/ступенчатый/ aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't
see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.

Ron, though/хоть/, was staring/уставившись/ transfixed at his image.

"Look at me!" he said.

"Can you see all your family standing/постоянный/ around you?"

"No -- I'm alone/в одиночестве/ -- but I'm different -- I look older -- and I'm head
boy!"

"What?"

"I am -- I'm wearing/носить/ the badge like Bill used to -- and I'm holding the
house cup and the Quidditch cup -- I'm Quidditch captain, too.

Ron tore his eyes away/далеко/ from this splendid sight/взгляд/ to look excitedly at
Harry.

"Do you think this mirror shows the future?"

"How can it? All my family are dead -- let me have another look --"

"You had it to yourself/сам/ all last night, give me a bit more time."

"You're only holding the Quidditch cup, what's interesting about that? I
want to see my parents."

"Don't push me --"

A sudden/внезапный/ noise outside in the corridor/коридор/ put an end to their discussion.
They hadn't realized how loudly/громко/ they had been talking.

"Quick!"

Ron threw/бросил/ the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris/Norris/
came round the door. Ron and Harry stood/стоял/ quite/довольно/ still/все еще/, both thinking the
same thing -- did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed/казалось/ an age, she
turned/оказалось/ and left.

"This isn't safe -- she might have gone for Filch/стащить/, I bet/делать ставку/ she heard/услышанным/ us.
Come on."

And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.

The snow still/все еще/ hadn't melted the next morning.

"Want to play chess, Harry?" said Ron.

"No."

"Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid?"

"No... you go..."

"I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don't go back
tonight."

"Why not?"

"I dunno, I've just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway/так или иначе/, you've had
too many close shaves already. Filch/стащить/, Snape, and Mrs. Norris/Norris/ are
wandering around. So what if they can't see you? What if they walk into
you? What if you knock something over?"

"You sound like Hermione."

"I'm serious, Harry, don't go."

But Harry only had one thought/думал/ in his head, which was to get back in
front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him.

That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was
walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he
didn't meet anyone/кто угодно/.

And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of
his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in
front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all
night with his family. Nothing at all.

Except/Кроме/ --

"So -- back again, Harry?"

Harry felt/почувствовал/ as though/хоть/ his insides had turned/оказалось/ to ice. He looked behind/за/
him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none/никто/ other than Albus
Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight/Прямо/ past him, so desperate to
get to the mirror he hadn't noticed/заметил/ him.

" -- I didn't see you, sir."

"Strange/странный/ how nearsighted being/являющийся/ invisible can make you," said Dumbledore,
and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.

"So," said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with
Harry, "you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of
the Mirror of Erised."

"I didn't know it was called that, Sir."

"But I expect you've realized by now what it does?"

"It -- well -- it shows me my family --"

"And it showed your friend Ron himself/сам/ as head boy."

"How did you know --?"

"I don't need a cloak to become invisible," said Dumbledore gently.
"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?"

Harry shook/встряхнул/ his head.

"Let me explain/объяснять/. The happiest man on earth would be able/в состоянии/ to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it
and see himself/сам/ exactly/в точку/ as he is. Does that help?"

Harry thought/думал/. Then he said slowly, "It shows us what we want...
whatever/без разницы/ we want..."

"Yes and no," said Dumbledore quietly/тихо/. "It shows us nothing more or less
than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have
never known your family, see them standing/постоянный/ around you. Ronald Weasley/Уизли/,
who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself/сам/ standing/постоянный/
alone/в одиночестве/, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us
neither/ни/ knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away/далеко/ before it, entranced by
what they have seen, or been driven mad/Сумасшедший/, not knowing/знание/ if what it shows is
real or even possible.

"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you
not to go looking for it again. If you ever/Когда-либо/ do run across/через/ it, you will
now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget/забывать/ to live,
remember that. Now, why don't you put that admirable cloak back on and
get off to bed?"

Harry stood/стоял/ up.

"Sir -- Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?"

"Obviously/очевидно/, you've just done so," Dumbledore smiled. "You may ask me one
more thing, however."

"What do you see when you look in the mirror?"

"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick/толстый/, woolen socks."

Harry stared.

"One can never have enough/достаточно/ socks," said Dumbledore. "Another Christmas
has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. People will insist on
giving me books."

It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore
might not have been quite/довольно/ truthful. But then, he thought/думал/, as he shoved
Scabbers/Scabbers/ off his pillow, it had been quite/довольно/ a personal question.


CHAPTER THIRTEEN

NICOLAS FLAMEL/Фламель/

Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of
Erised again, and for the rest/отдых/ of the Christmas holidays the
invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry
wished he could forget/забывать/ what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he
couldn't. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed
about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high
voice cackled with laughter.

"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad/Сумасшедший/," said
Ron, when Harry told him about these/эти/ drearns.

Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took/взял/ a different
view of things. She was torn between horror/ужастик/ at the idea of Harry being/являющийся/
out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row ("If Filch/стащить/ had
caught/пойманный/ you!"), and disappointment that he hadn't at least/наименее/ found out who
Nicolas Flamel/Фламель/ was.

They had almost/почти/ given up hope of ever/Когда-либо/ finding Flamel/Фламель/ in a li- brary
book, even though/хоть/ Harry was still/все еще/ sure he'd read the name somewhere/где-то/.
Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten
minutes during/в течение/ their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other
two, because Quidditch practice had started again.

Wood was working the team harder than ever/Когда-либо/. Even the endless rain that
had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits. The Weasleys/Уизли/
complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's
side. If they won/выиграл/ their next match, against/против/ Hufflepuff/хаффлпаффец/, they would
overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven
years. Quite/довольно/ apart/Кроме/ from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer
nightmares when he was tired out after training.

Then, during/в течение/ one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave/дал/
the team a bit of bad news. He'd just gotten/полученный/ very angry with the
Weasleys/Уизли/, who kept/держали/ dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall/падать/ off
their brooms/веники/.

"Will you stop messing around!" he yelled/вопил/. "That's exactly/в точку/ the sort of
thing that'll lose/потерять/ us the match! Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll
be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!"

George Weasley/Уизли/ really did fall/падать/ off his broom/метла/ at these/эти/ words.

"Snape's refereeing?" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. "When's
he ever/Когда-либо/ refereed a Quidditch match? He's not going to be fair if we
might overtake Slytherin."

The rest/отдых/ of the team landed/высадился/ next to George to complain, too.

"It's not my fault," said Wood. "We've just got to make sure we play a
clean game, so Snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on us."

Which was all very well, thought/думал/ Harry, but he had another reason for
not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch....

The rest/отдых/ of the team hung/висела/ back to talk to one another as usual at the
end of practice, but Harry headed straight/Прямо/ back to the Gryffindor common
room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only
thing Hermione ever/Когда-либо/ lost at, something Harry and Ron thought/думал/ was very
good for her.

"Don't talk to me for a moment," said Ron when Harry sat/сидел/ down next to
him, "I need to concen --" He caught/пойманный/ sight/взгляд/ of Harry's face. "What's the
matter/дело/ with you? You look terrible."

Speaking quietly/тихо/ so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other
two about Snape's sudden/внезапный/, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.

"Don't play," said Hermione at once.

"Say you're ill," said Ron.

"Pretend to break your leg/нога/," Hermione suggested.

"Really break your leg/нога/," said Ron.

"I can't," said Harry. "There isn't a reserve Seeker/искатель/. If I back out,
Gryffindor can't play at all."

At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed/удалось/
to climb through the portrait hole was anyone/кто угодно/'s guess, because his legs/ноги/
had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the
Leg/нога/-Locker Curse/проклятие/. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to
Gryffindor tower.

Everyone fell/упал/ over laughing except/Кроме/ Hermione, who leapt/прыгнула/ up and performed
the countercurse. Neville's legs/ноги/ sprang apart/Кроме/ and he got to his feet/ноги/,
trembling. "What happened?" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit
with Harry and Ron.

"Malfoy," said Neville shakily. "I met him outside the library. He said
he'd been looking for someone/кто то/ to practice that on."

"Go to Professor McGonagall!" Hermione urged Neville. "Report him!"

Neville shook/встряхнул/ his head.

"I don't want more trouble/беда/," he mumbled.

"You've got to stand/стоять/ up to him, Neville!" said Ron. "He's used to
walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of
him and make it easier."

"There's no need to tell me I'm not brave enough/достаточно/ to be in Gryffindor,
Malfoy's already done that," Neville choked out.

Harry felt/почувствовал/ in the pocket/карман/ of his robes/робы/ and pulled out a Chocolate Frog,
the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He
gave/дал/ it to Neville, who looked as though/хоть/ he might cry.

"You're worth twelve of Malfoy," Harry said. "The Sorting Hat/шапка/ chose you
for Gryffindor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin."

Neville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.

"Thanks, Harry... I think I'll go to bed.... D'you want the card, you
collect them, don't you?"

As Neville walked away/далеко/, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.

"Dumbledore again," he said, "He was the first one I ever/Когда-либо/-"

He gasped/ахнула/. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron
and Hermione.

"I've found him!" he whispered/прошептал/. "I've found Flamel/Фламель/! I told you I'd read
the name somewhere/где-то/ before, I read it on the train coming/приход/ here -- listen
to this: 'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark
wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of
dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas
Flamel/Фламель/'!"

Hermione jumped to her feet/ноги/. She hadn't looked so excited since they'd
gotten/полученный/ back the marks for their very first piece of homework.

"Stay there!" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs/лестница/ to the girls'
dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks
before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms/оружие/.

"I never thought/думал/ to look in here!" she whispered/прошептал/ excitedly. "I got this
out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading."

"Light?" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet/тихо/ until/до/ she'd looked
something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages,
muttering to herself.

At last she found what she was looking for.

"I knew it! I knew it!"

"Are we allowed to speak yet?" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.

"Nicolas Flamel/Фламель/," she whispered/прошептал/ dramatically, "is the only known maker
of the Sorcerer's Stone!"

This didn't have quite/довольно/ the effect she'd expected/ожидаемый/.

"The what?" said Harry and Ron.

"Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look -- read that, there."

She pushed the book toward/к/ them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient
study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a
legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform
any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which
will make the drinker immortal.

There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries,
but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel/Фламель/,
the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel/Фламель/, who celebrated his six
hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet/тихо/ life in Devon
with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).

"See?" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. "The dog must be
guarding/охранные/ Flamel/Фламель/'s Sorcerer's Stone! I bet/делать ставку/ he asked Dumbledore to keep it
safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone/кто то/ was after it,
that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!"

"A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever/Когда-либо/ dying!" said Harry. "No
wonder/задаваться вопросом/ Snape's after it! Anyone/кто угодно/ would want it."

"And no wonder/задаваться вопросом/ we couldn't find Flamel/Фламель/ in that Study of Recent
Developments in Wizardry," said Ron. "He's not exactly/в точку/ recent if he's
six hundred and sixty-five, is he?"

The next morning in Defense Against/против/ the Dark Arts, while copying down
different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still/все еще/
discussing what they'd do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had one. It
wasn't until/до/ Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry
remembered/вспомнил/ about Snape and the coming/приход/ match.

"I'm going to play," he told Ron and Hermione. "If I don't, all the
Slytherins will think I'm just too scared/испуганный/ to face Snape. I'll show
them... it'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win."

"Just as long as we're not wiping you off the field," said Hermione.

As the match drew nearer/ближе/, however, Harry became/стал/ more and more nervous,
whatever/без разницы/ he told Ron and Hermione. The rest/отдых/ of the team wasn't too calm,
either/или/. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was
wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed
to, with such a biased referee?

Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed/казалось/ to
keep running into Snape wherever he went/отправился/. At times, he even wondered/задавались вопросом/
whether Snape was following him, trying to catch/поймать/ him on his own. Potions/зелий/
lessons were turning/превращение/ into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so
horrible/какой ужас/ to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they'd found out about the
Sorcerer's Stone? Harry didn't see how he could -- yet he sometimes had
the horrible/какой ужас/ feeling that Snape could read minds.

Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the
next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering/интересно/ whether they'd ever/Когда-либо/
see him alive again. This wasn't what you'd call comforting. Harry
hardly heard/услышанным/ a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch
robes/робы/ and picked/выбрал/ up his Nimbus/нимб/ Two Thousand.

Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to
Neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or
why they had both brought/привел/ their wands/палочки/ to the match. Little did Harry
know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg/нога/-Locker
Curse/проклятие/. They'd gotten/полученный/ the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were
ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt/причинить боль/ Harry.

"Now, don't forget/забывать/, it's Locomotor Mortis," Hermione muttered/пробормотал/ as Ron
slipped/поскользнулся/ his wand/палочка/ up his sleeve.

"I know," Ron snapped/щелкнул/. "Don't nag."

Back in the locker room, Wood had taken/взятый/ Harry aside.

"Don't want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever/Когда-либо/ need an early
capture of the Snitch/доносчик/ it's now. Finish the game before Snape can favor
Hufflepuff/хаффлпаффец/ too much."

"The whole school's out there!" said Fred Weasley/Уизли/, peering out of the
door. "Even -- blimey -- Dumbledore's come to watch!"

Harry's heart did a somersault.

"Dumbledore?" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right.
There was no mistaking that silver beard/борода/.

Harry could have laughed out loud/громкий/ with relief He was safe. There was
simply no way that Snape would dare/сметь/ to try to hurt/причинить боль/ him if Dumbledore was
watching.

Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched
onto/на/ the field, something that Ron noticed/заметил/, too.

"I've never seen Snape look so mean," he told Hermione. "Look -they're
off Ouch!"

Someone/кто то/ had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.

"Oh, sorry, Weasley/Уизли/, didn't see you there."

Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe/Крэбб/ and Goyle.

"Wonder/задаваться вопросом/ how long Potter's going to stay on his broom/метла/ this time? Anyone/кто угодно/
want a bet/делать ставку/? What about you, Weasley/Уизли/?"

Ron didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff/хаффлпаффец/ a penalty because
George Weasley/Уизли/ had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her
fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was
circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch/доносчик/.

"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?" said
Malfoy loudly/громко/ a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff/хаффлпаффец/ another
penalty for no reason at all. "It's people they feel sorry for. See,
there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's the Weasleys/Уизли/, who've
got no money -- you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no
brains."

Neville went/отправился/ bright/яркий/ red but turned/оказалось/ in his seat to face Malfoy.

"I'm worth twelve of you, Malfoy," he stammered.

Malfoy, Crabbe/Крэбб/, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still/все еще/ not
daring to take his eyes from the game, said, "You tell him, Neville."

"Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Weasley/Уизли/, and
that's saying something."

Ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety
about Harry.

"I'm warning you, Malfoy -- one more word

"Ron!" said Hermione suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/, "Harry --"

"What? Where?"

Harry had suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and
cheers from the crowd/толпа/. Hermione stood/стоял/ up, her crossed fingers in her
mouth, as Harry streaked toward/к/ the ground/земля/ like a bullet.

"You're in luck, Weasley/Уизли/, Potter's obviously/очевидно/ spotted/пятнистый/ some money on the
ground/земля/!" said Malfoy.

Ron snapped/щелкнул/. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of
him, wrestling him to the ground/земля/. Neville hesitated, then clambered over
the back of his seat to help.

"Come on, Harry!" Hermione screamed/кричал/, leaping onto/на/ her seat to watch as
Harry sped straight/Прямо/ at Snape -- she didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron
rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming/приход/ from the
whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe/Крэбб/, and Goyle.

Up in the air, Snape turned/оказалось/ on his broomstick/метловище/ just in time to see
something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next
second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm/рука/ raised/поднятый/ in triumph, the
Snitch/доносчик/ clasped in his hand.

The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever/Когда-либо/ remember
the Snitch/доносчик/ being/являющийся/ caught/пойманный/ so quickly.

"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game's over! Harry's won/выиграл/! We've won/выиграл/!
Gryffindor is in the lead!" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on
her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.

Harry jumped off his broom/метла/, a foot from the ground/земля/. He couldn't believe/верить/
it. He'd done it -- the game was over; it had barely lasted five
minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto/на/ the field, he saw Snape land
nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then Harry felt/почувствовал/ a hand on his
shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face.

"Well done," said Dumbledore quietly/тихо/, so that only Harry could hear.
"Nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror... been keeping/хранение/
busy... excellent..."

Snape spat bitterly on the ground/земля/.

Harry left the locker room alone/в одиночестве/ some time later, to take his Nimbus/нимб/ Two
Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn't ever/Когда-либо/ remember feeling
happier. He'd really done something to be proud of now -- no one could
say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never
smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour
in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him
onto/на/ their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and
down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.

Harry had reached/достиг/ the shed/сарай/. He leaned/подался/ against/против/ the wooden door and looked
up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun.
Gryffindor in the lead. He'd done it, he'd shown Snape....

And speaking of Snape...

A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly
not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward/к/ the
forbidden forest. Harry's victory faded from his mind/разум/ as he watched. He
recognized the figure's prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest
while everyone else was at dinner -- what was going on?

Harry jumped back on his Nimbus/нимб/ Two Thousand and took/взял/ off. Gliding
silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He
followed/с последующим/.

The trees were so thick/толстый/ he couldn't see where Snape had gone. He flew/полетели/ in
circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until/до/ he
heard/услышанным/ voices. He glided toward/к/ them and landed/высадился/ noiselessly in a towering
beech tree.

He climbed/поднялся/ carefully along/вдоль/ one of the branches, holding tight to his
broomstick/метловище/, trying to see through the leaves. Below, in a shadowy
clearing/клиринг/, stood/стоял/ Snape, but he wasn't alone/в одиночестве/. Quirrell was there, too.
Harry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering
worse/хуже/ than ever/Когда-либо/. Harry strained to catch/поймать/ what they were saying.

"... d-don't know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places,
Severus..."

"Oh, I thought/думал/ we'd keep this private," said Snape, his voice icy.
"Students aren't supposed/предполагаемый/ to know about the Sorcerer's Stone, after
all."

Harry leaned/подался/ forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted
him.

"Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?"

"B-b-but Severus, I --"

"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell," said Snape, taking a step
toward/к/ him.

"I-I don't know what you

"You know perfectly well what I mean."

An owl/сова/ hooted loudly/громко/, and Harry nearly fell/упал/ out of the tree. He steadied
himself/сам/ in time to hear Snape say, "-- your little bit of hocus-pocus.
I'm waiting."

"B-but I d-d-don't --"

"Very well," Snape cut in. "We'll have another little chat soon/скоро/, when
you've had time to think things over and decided/приняли решение/ where your loyalties
lie."

He threw/бросил/ his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing/клиринг/. It was
almost/почти/ dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing/постоянный/ quite/довольно/ still/все еще/ as
though/хоть/ he was petrified.

"Harry, where have you been?" Hermione squeaked.

"We won/выиграл/! You won/выиграл/! We won/выиграл/!" shouted/кричал/ Ron, thumping Harry on the back. "And
I gave/дал/ Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried/пытался/ to take on Crabbe/Крэбб/ and Goyle
single-handed! He's still/все еще/ out cold but Madam Pomftey says he'll be all
right - talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone's waiting for you in the
common room, we're having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and
stuff/материал/ from the kitchens."

"Never mind/разум/ that now," said Harry breathlessly. "Let's find an empty
room, you wait 'til you hear this...."

He made sure Peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind/за/ them,
then he told them what he'd seen and heard/услышанным/.

"So we were right, it is the Sorcerer's Stone, and Snape's trying to
force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past
Fluffy/пушистый/ - and he said something about Quirrell's 'hocus pocuss-- I reckon
there are other things guarding/охранные/ the stone apart/Кроме/ from Fluffy/пушистый/, loads of
enchantments, probably/вероятно/, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts
spell/орфографии/ that Snape needs to break through --"

"So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to
Snape?" said Hermione in alarm.

"It'll be gone by next Tuesday," said Ron.


CHAPTER FOURTEEN

NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK

Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they'd thought/думал/. In the
weeks that followed/с последующим/ he did seem/казаться/ to be getting paler and thinner, but it
didn't look as though/хоть/ he'd cracked yet.

Every time they passed/прошло/ the third-floor corridor/коридор/, Harry, Ron, and
Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy/пушистый/ was
still/все еще/ growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper,
which surely meant that the Stone was still/все еще/ safe. Whenever Harry passed/прошло/
Quirrell these/эти/ days he gave/дал/ him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron
had started telling/говоря/ people off for laughing at Quirrell's stutter.

Hermione, however, had more on her mind/разум/ than the Sorcerer's Stone. She
had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes.
Harry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept/держали/ nagging them to do the
same.

"Hermione, the exams are ages away/далеко/."

"Ten weeks," Hermione snapped/щелкнул/. "That's not ages, that's like a second to
Nicolas Flamel/Фламель/."

"But we're not six hundred years old," Ron reminded/напомнил/ her. "Anyway/так или иначе/, what
are you studying for, you already know it A."

"What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass
these/эти/ exams to get into the second year? They're very important, I
should have started studying a month ago, I don't know what's gotten/полученный/
into me...."

Unfortunately, the teachers seemed/казалось/ to be thinking along/вдоль/ the same lines
as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter
holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones/те,/. It was hard
to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's
blood or practicing wand/палочка/ movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron
spent/потраченный/ most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get
through all their extra work.

"I'll never remember this," Ron burst/взрыв/ out one afternoon, throwing/бросание/ down
his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the
first really fine day they'd had in months. The sky was a clear,
forget/забывать/-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming/приход/.

Harry, who was looking up "Dittany" in One Thousand Magical Herbs and
Fungi, didn't look up until/до/ he heard/услышанным/ Ron say, "Hagrid! What are you
doing in the library?"

Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind/за/ his back. He looked
very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.

"Jus' lookin'," he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at
once. "An' what're you lot up ter/тер/?" He looked suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ suspicious. "Yer/Ер/
not still/все еще/ lookin' fer/фер/ Nicolas Flamel/Фламель/, are yeh?" "Oh, we found out who he
is ages ago," said Ron impressively. "And we know what that dog's
guarding/охранные/, it's a Sorcerer's St --"

"Shhhh!" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone/кто угодно/ was listening.
"Don' go shoutin' about it, what's the matter/дело/ with yeh?"

"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter/дело/ of fact," said
Harry, "about what's guarding/охранные/ the Stone apart/Кроме/ from Fluffy/пушистый/ --"

"SHHHH!" said Hagrid again. "Listen - come an' see me later, I'm not
promisin' I'll tell yeh anythin/хоть что/', mind/разум/, but don' go rabbitin' about it
in here, students aren' s'pposed ter/тер/ know. They'll think I've told yeh
--"

"See you later, then," said Harry.

Hagrid shuffled off.

"What was he hiding behind/за/ his back?" said Hermione thoughtfully.

"Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?"

"I'm going to see what section he was in," said Ron, who'd had enough/достаточно/ of
working. He came back a minute later with a pile/свая/ of books in his arms/оружие/
and slammed them down on the table.

"Dragons!" he whispered/прошептал/. "Hagrid was looking up stuff/материал/ about dragons!
Look at these/эти/: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to
Inferno, A Dragon Keeper/хранитель/'s Guide."

"Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever/Когда-либо/
met him, " said Harry.

"But it's against/против/ our laws," said Ron. "Dragon breeding was outlawed by
the Warlocks' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It's hard to stop
Muggles from noticing us if we're keeping/хранение/ dragons in the back garden -
anyway/так или иначе/, you can't tame dragons, it's dangerous. You should see the burns
Charlie's got off wild ones/те,/ in Romania."

"But there aren't wild dragons in Britain?" said Harry.

"Of course there are," said Ron. "Common Welsh Green and Hebridean
Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you.
Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who've spotted/пятнистый/ them, to
make them forget/забывать/."

"So what on earths Hagrid up to?" said Hermione.

When they knocked/постучался/ on the door of the gamekeeper's hut/хижина/ an hour later,
they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid
called "Who is it?" before he let them in, and then shut/закрыть/ the door
quickly behind/за/ them.

It was stifling hot inside. Even though/хоть/ it was such a warm day, there
was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them
stoat sandwiches, which they refused.

"So -- yeh wanted to ask me somethin'?"

"Yes," said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. "We were
wondering/интересно/ if you could tell us what's guarding/охранные/ the Sorcerer's Stone
apart/Кроме/ from Fluffy/пушистый/."

Hagrid frowned at him.

"0' course I cant, he said. "Number one, I don' know meself. Number two,
yeh know too much already, so I wouldn' tell yeh if I could. That
Stone's here fer/фер/ a good reason. It Was almost/почти/ stolen outta/убираться/ Gringotts - I
s'ppose yeh've worked that out an' all? Beats me how yeh even know abou'
Fluffy/пушистый/."

"Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know,
you know everything/все/ that goes/идет/ on round here," said Hermione in a warm,
flattering voice. Hagrid's beard/борода/ twitched and they could tell he was
smiling. "We only wondered/задавались вопросом/ who had done the guarding/охранные/, really." Hermione
went/отправился/ on. "We wondered/задавались вопросом/ who Dumbledore had trusted enough/достаточно/ to help him,
apart/Кроме/ from you."

Hagrid's chest swelled at these/эти/ last words. Harry and Ron beamed at
Hermione.

"Well, I don' s'pose it could hurt/причинить боль/ ter/тер/ tell yeh that... let's see... he
borrowed Fluffy/пушистый/ from me... then some o' the teachers did enchantments...
Professor Sprout -- Professor Flitwick -- Professor McGonagall --" he
ticked them off on his fingers, "Professor Quirrell -- an' Dumbledore
himself/сам/ did somethin', o' course. Hang/вешать/ on, I've forgotten/забытый/ someone/кто то/. Oh
yeah, Professor Snape."

"Snape?"

"Yeah -- yer/Ер/ not still/все еще/ on abou' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped
protect the Stone, he's not about ter/тер/ steal/украсть/ it."

Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape
had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out
how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably/вероятно/ knew everything/все/ --
except/Кроме/, it seemed/казалось/, Quirrell's spell/орфографии/ and how to get past Fluffy/пушистый/.

"You're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy/пушистый/. aren't you,
Hagrid?" said Harry anxiously. "And you wouldn't tell anyone/кто угодно/, would you?
Not even one of the teachers?"

"Not a soul knows except/Кроме/ me an' Dumbledore," said Hagrid proudly.

"Well, that's something," Harry muttered/пробормотал/ to the others. "Hagrid, can we
have a window open? I'm boiling."

"Can't, Harry, sorry," said Hagrid. Harry noticed/заметил/ him glance at the
fire. Harry looked at it, too.

"Hagrid -- what's that?"

But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire,
underneath/под/ the kettle, was a huge, black egg.

"Ah," said Hagrid, fiddling nervously/нервно/ with his beard/борода/, "That's er/эр/..."

"Where did you get it, Hagrid?" said Ron, crouching over the fire to get
a closer/ближе/ look at the egg. "It must've cost you a fortune."

"Won/выиграл/ it," said Hagrid. "Las' night. I was down in the village havin' a
few drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger. Think he was
quite/довольно/ glad/довольный/ ter/тер/ get rid of it, ter/тер/ be honest."

"But what are you going to do with it when it's hatched?" said Hermione.

"Well, I've bin/бункер/ doin' some readin' , said Hagrid, pulling a large book
from under his pillow. "Got this outta/убираться/ the library -- Dragon Breeding
for Pleasure and Profit -- it's a bit outta/убираться/ date, o' course, but it's
all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, 'cause their mothers breathe on I
em/Эм/, see, an' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with
chicken blood every half hour. An' see here -- how ter/тер/ recognize
diff'rent eggs -- what I got there's a Norwegian Ridgeback. They're
rare, them."

He looked very pleased/довольный/ with himself/сам/, but Hermione didn't.

"Hagrid, you live in a wooden house," she said.

But Hagrid wasn't listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the
fire.

So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to
Hagrid if anyone/кто угодно/ found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut/хижина/.
"Wonder/задаваться вопросом/ what it's like to have a peaceful life," Ron sighed, as evening
after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were
getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and
Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.

Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig/Хедвиг/ brought/привел/ Harry another note/заметка/ from Hagrid.
He had written only two words: It's hatching.

Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight/Прямо/ down to the hut/хижина/. Hermione
wouldn't hear of it.

"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon
hatching?"

"We've got lessons, we'll get into trouble/беда/, and that's nothing to what
Hagrid's going to be in when someone/кто то/ finds out what he's doing --"

"Shut/закрыть/ up!" Harry whispered/прошептал/.

Malfoy was only a few feet/ноги/ away/далеко/ and he had stopped dead to listen. How
much had he heard/услышанным/? Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all.

Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end,
Hermione agreed/согласовано/ to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during/в течение/
morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their
lesson, the three of them dropped/упал/ their trowels at once and hurried/торопливый/
through the grounds/основания/ to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them,
looking flushed and excited.

"It's nearly out." He ushered them inside.

The egg was lying/лежащий/ on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something
was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming/приход/ from it.

They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated
breath/дыхание/.

All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby
dragon flopped onto/на/ the table. It wasn't exactly/в точку/ pretty; Harry thought/думал/
it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge
compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide/широкий/ nostrils,
the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.

It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew/полетели/ out of its snout.

"Isn't he beautiful?" Hagrid murmured. He reached/достиг/ out a hand to stroke
the dragon's head. It snapped/щелкнул/ at his fingers, showing pointed/заостренный/ fangs.

"Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!" said Hagrid.

"Hagrid," said Hermione, "how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow,
exactly/в точку/?"

Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ drained from his face
-- he leapt/прыгнула/ to his feet/ноги/ and ran to the window.

"What's the matter/дело/?"

"Someone/кто то/ was lookin' through the gap in the curtains -- it's a kid --
he's runnin' back up ter/тер/ the school."

Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no
mistaking him.

Malfoy had seen the dragon.

Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during/в течение/ the next week
made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent/потраченный/ most of their
free time in Hagrid's darkened hut/хижина/, trying to reason with him.

"Just let him go," Harry urged. "Set him free."

"I can't," said Hagrid. "He's too little. He'd die."

They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a
week. Smoke kept/держали/ furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn't been doing
his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping/хранение/ him so busy. There
were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.

"I've decided/приняли решение/ to call him Norbert," said Hagrid, looking at the dragon
with misty eyes. "He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert!
Where's Mommy?"

"He's lost his marbles," Ron muttered/пробормотал/ in Harry's ear.

"Hagrid," said Harry loudly/громко/, "give it two weeks and Norbert's going to
be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment."

Hagrid bit his lip.

"I -- I know I can't keep him forever, but I can't jus' dump him, I
can't."

Harry suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ turned/оказалось/ to Ron. Charlie, he said.

"You're losing it, too," said Ron. "I'm Ron, remember?"

"No -- Charlie -- your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons.
We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put
him back in the wild!"

"Brilliant!" said Ron. "How about it, Hagrid?"

And in the end, Hagrid agreed/согласовано/ that they could send -an owl/сова/ to Charlie to
ask him.

The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry
sitting alone/в одиночестве/ in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to
bed. The clock on the wall had just

chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst/взрыв/ open. Ron appeared/появился/ out of
nowhere as he pulled off Harry's invisibility cloak. He had been down at
Hagrid's hut/хижина/, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by
the crate/клеть/.

"It bit me!" he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a
bloody handkerchief. "I'm not going to be able/в состоянии/ to hold a quill for a
week. I tell you, that dragon's the most horrible/какой ужас/ animal I've ever/Когда-либо/ met,
but the way Hagrid goes/идет/ on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy/пушистый/ little
bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when
I left, he was singing it a lullaby."

There was a tap on the dark window.

"It's Hedwig/Хедвиг/!" said Harry, hurrying to let her in. "She'll have
Charlie's answer!"

The three of them put their heads/руководители/ together to read the note/заметка/.

Dear Ron,

How are you? Thanks for the letter -- I'd be glad/довольный/ to take the Norwegian
Ridgeback, but it won/выиграл/'t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing
will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming/приход/ to
visit me next week. Trouble/беда/ is, they mustn't be seen carrying/проведение/ an illegal
dragon.

Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on
Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away/далеко/ while it's still/все еще/
dark.

Send me an answer as soon/скоро/ as possible.

Love,

Charlie

They looked at one another.

"We've got the invisibility cloak," said Harry. "It shouldn't be too
difficult -- I think the cloaks big enough/достаточно/ to cover two of us and
Norbert."

It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two
agreed/согласовано/ with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert -- and Malfoy.

There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen to
twice its usual size. He didn't know whether it was safe to go to Madam
Pomfrey/Помфрей/ -- would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though/хоть/,
he had no choice. The cut had turned/оказалось/ a nasty/противный/ shade of green. It looked
as if Norbert's fangs were poisonous.

Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day
to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.

"It's not just my hand," he whispered/прошептал/, "although/несмотря на то что/ that feels like it's
about to fall/падать/ off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey/Помфрей/ he wanted to borrow one of
my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept/держали/
threatening to tell her what really bit me -- I've told her it was a
dog, but I don't think she believes me -I shouldn't have hit him at the
Quidditch match, that's why he's doing this."

Harry and Hermione tried/пытался/ to calm Ron down.

"It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday," said Hermione, but this
didn't soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat/сидел/ bolt upright and broke
into a sweat.

"Midnight on Saturday!" he said in a hoarse voice. "Oh no oh no -- I've
just remembered/вспомнил/ -- Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took/взял/, he's
going to know we're getting rid of Norbert."

Harry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey/Помфрей/ came
over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.

"It's too late to change the plan now," Harry told Hermione. "We haven't
got time to send Charlie another owl/сова/, and this could be our only chance
to get rid of Norbert. We'll have to risk it. And we have got the
invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn't know about that."

They found Fang/клык/, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail
when they went/отправился/ to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.

"I won/выиграл/'t let you in," he puffed. "Norbert's at a tricky stage -- nothin'
I can't handle."

When they told him about Charlie's letter, his eyes filled with tears,
although/несмотря на то что/ that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the
leg/нога/.

"Aargh! It's all right, he only got my boot -- jus' playin' -- he's only
a baby, after all."

The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry
and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come
quickly enough/достаточно/.

They would have felt/почувствовал/ sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say
good-bye to Norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had
to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late
arriving at Hagrid's hut/хижина/ because they'd had to wait for Peeves to get
out of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis
against/против/ the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate/клеть/.

"He's got lots o' rats an' some brandy fer/фер/ the journey," said Hagrid in
a muffled voice. "An' I've packed his teddy bear in case he gets
lonely."

From inside the crate/клеть/ came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as
though/хоть/ the teddy was having his head torn off.

"Bye-bye, Norbert!" Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the
crate/клеть/ with the invisibility cloak and stepped/ступенчатый/ underneath/под/ it themselves/самих себя/.
"Mommy will never forget/забывать/ you!"

How they managed/удалось/ to get the crate/клеть/ back up to the castle, they never
knew. Midnight ticked nearer/ближе/ as they heaved Norbert up the marble
staircase/лестница/ in the entrance hall and along/вдоль/ the dark corridors. UP another
staircase/лестница/, then another -- even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the
work much easier.

"Nearly there!" Harry panted as they reached/достиг/ the corridor/коридор/ beneath the
tallest tower.

Then a sudden/внезапный/ movement ahead/впереди/ of them made them almost/почти/ drop the crate/клеть/.
Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the
shadows, staring/уставившись/ at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each
other ten feet/ноги/ away/далеко/. A lamp flared.

Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by
the ear.

"Detention!" she shouted/кричал/. "And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering
around in the middle of the night, how dare/сметь/ you --"

"You don't understand, Professor. Harry Potter's coming/приход/ -- he's got a
dragon!"

"What utter rubbish! How dare/сметь/ you tell such lies! Come on -- I shall see
Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!"

The steep spiral staircase/лестница/ up to the top of the tower seemed/казалось/ the easiest
thing in the world after that. Not until/до/ they'd stepped/ступенчатый/ out into the
cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad/довольный/ to be able/в состоянии/ to breathe
properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.

"Malfoy's got detention! I could sing!"

"Don't," Harry advised her.

Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his
crate/клеть/. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out
of the darkness.

Charlie's friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the
harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them.
They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and
Hermione shook/встряхнул/ hands with the others and thanked them very much.

At last, Norbert was going... going... gone.

They slipped/поскользнулся/ back down the spiral staircase/лестница/, their hearts as light as
their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon -- Malfoy in
detention -- what could spoil their happiness?

The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs/лестница/. As they
stepped/ступенчатый/ into the corridor/коридор/, Filch/стащить/'s face loomed suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ out of the
darkness.

"Well, well, well," he whispered/прошептал/, "we are in trouble/беда/."

They'd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.


CHAPTER FIFTEEN

THE FORIBIDDEN FOREST

Things couldn't have been worse/хуже/.

Filch/стащить/ took/взял/ them down to Professor McGonagall's study on the first floor,
where they sat/сидел/ and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione
was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each
other around Harry's brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn't
see how they were going to get out of trouble/беда/ this time. They were
cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget/забывать/ the cloak?
There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for
their being/являющийся/ out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of
night, let alone/в одиночестве/ being/являющийся/ up the tallest astronomy tower, which was
out-of-bounds except/Кроме/ for classes. Add Norbert and the invisibility
cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.

Had Harry thought/думал/ that things couldn't have been worse/хуже/? He was wrong/неправильно/.
When Professor McGonagall appeared/появился/, she was leading Neville.

"Harry!" Neville burst/взрыв/ Out, the moment he saw the other two. "I was
trying to find you to warn you, I heard/услышанным/ Malfoy saying he was going to
catch/поймать/ you, he said you had a drag --"

Harry shook/встряхнул/ his head violently to shut/закрыть/ Neville up, but Professor
McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert
as she towered over the three of them.

"I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch/стащить/ says you were
up in the astronomy tower. It's one o'clock in the morning. Explain/объяснять/
yourselves."

It was the first time Hermione had ever/Когда-либо/ failed to answer a teacher's
question. She was staring/уставившись/ at her slippers, as still/все еще/ as a statue.

"I think I've got a good idea of what's been going on," said Professor
McGonagall. "It doesn't take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco
Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of
bed and into trouble/беда/. I've already caught/пойманный/ him. I suppose/предполагать/ you think it's
funny that Longbottom here heard/услышанным/ the story and believed it, too?"

Harry caught/пойманный/ Neville's eye and tried/пытался/ to tell him without words that this
wasn't true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt/причинить боль/. Poor,
blundering Neville -- Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and
find them in the dark, to warn them.

"I'm disgusted," said Professor McGonagall. "Four students out of bed in
one night! I've never heard/услышанным/ of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I
thought/думал/ you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought/думал/ Gryffindor
meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions --
yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around
school at night, especially these/эти/ days, it's very dangerous -- and fifty
points will be taken/взятый/ from Gryffindor."

"Fifty?" Harry gasped/ахнула/ -- they would lose/потерять/ the lead, the lead he'd won/выиграл/ in
the last Quidditch match.

"Fifty points each," said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily
through her long, pointed/заостренный/ nose/нос/.

"Professor -- please

"You can't --"

"Don't tell me what I can and can't do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all
of you. I've never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students."

A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In
one night, they'd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house
cup. Harry felt/почувствовал/ as though/хоть/ the bottom had dropped/упал/ out of his stomach. How
could they ever/Когда-либо/ make up for this?

Harry didn't sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his
pillow for what seemed/казалось/ like hours. Harry couldn't think of anything to
say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself/сам/, was dreading the
dawn. What would happen when the rest/отдых/ of Gryffindor found out what
they'd done?

At first, Gryffindors passing the giant/гигант/ hourglasses that recorded the
house points the next day thought/думал/ there'd been a mistake. How could they
suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then
the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter,
their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lo st them all those/те/ points,
him and a couple of other stupid first years.

From being/являющийся/ one of the most popular and admired people at the school,
Harry was suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs
turned/оказалось/ on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose/потерять/
the house cup. Everywhere Harry went/отправился/, people pointed/заостренный/ and didn't trouble/беда/
to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other
hand, clapped/захлопала/ as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, "Thanks
Potter, we owe you one!"

Only Ron stood/стоял/ by him.

"They'll all forget/забывать/ this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads
of points in all the time they've been here, and people still/все еще/ like
them."

"They've never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though/хоть/, have
they?" said Harry miserably.

"Well -- no," Ron admitted.

It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself/сам/ not
to meddle in things that weren't his business from now on. He'd had it
with sneaking around and spying. He felt/почувствовал/ so ashamed of himself/сам/ that he
went/отправился/ to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.

"Resign?" Wood thundered. "What good'll that do? How are we going to get
any points back if we can't win at Quidditch?"

But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest/отдых/ of the team wouldn't speak
to Harry during/в течение/ practice, and if they had to speak about him, they
called him "the Seeker/искатель/."

Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn't have as bad a time
as Harry, because they weren't as well-known, but nobody would speak to
them, either/или/. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in
class, keeping/хранение/ her head down and working in silence.

Harry was almost/почти/ glad/довольный/ that the exams weren't far away/далеко/. All the studying
he had to do kept/держали/ his mind/разум/ off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept/держали/ to
themselves/самих себя/, working late into the night, trying to remember the
ingredients in complicated potions/зелий/, learn charms and spells by heart,
memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions....

Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry's new
resolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him was put
to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one
afternoon, he heard/услышанным/ somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead/впереди/. As he
drew closer/ближе/, he heard/услышанным/ Quirrell's voice.

"No -- no -- not again, please --"

It sounded as though/хоть/ someone/кто то/ was threatening him. Harry moved closer/ближе/.

"All right -- all right --" he heard/услышанным/ Quirrell sob.

Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening
his turban. He was pale/бледный/ and looked as though/хоть/ he was about to cry. He
strode out of sight/взгляд/; Harry didn't think Quirrell had even noticed/заметил/ him.
He waited until/до/ Quirrell's footsteps had disappeared/исчез/, then peered into
the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood/стоял/ ajar at the other end.
Harry was halfway toward/к/ it before he remembered/вспомнил/ what he'd promised
himself/сам/ about not meddling.

All the same, he'd have gambled twelve Sorcerer's Stones that Snape had
just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard/услышанным/, Snape would be
walking with a new spring in his step -- Quirrell seemed/казалось/ to have given
in at last.

Harry went/отправился/ back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on
Astronomy. Harry told them what he'd heard/услышанным/.

"Snape's done it, then!" said Ron. "If Quirrell's told him how to break
his Anti-Dark Force spell/орфографии/ --"

"There's still/все еще/ Fluffy/пушистый/, though/хоть/," said Hermione.

"Maybe Snape's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,"
said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. "I bet/делать ставку/
there's a book somewhere/где-то/ in here telling/говоря/ you how to get past a giant/гигант/
three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?"

The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron's eyes, but Hermione
answered before Harry could.

"Go to Dumbledore. That's what we should have done ages ago. If we try
anything ourselves we'll be thrown out for sure."

"But we've got no proof!" said Harry. "Quirrell's too scared/испуганный/ to back us
up. Snape's only got to say he doesn't know how the troll got in at
Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor -- who do you
think they'll believe/верить/, him or us? It's not exactly/в точку/ a secret we hate him,
Dumbledore'll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch/стащить/ wouldn't help
us if his life depended on it, he's too friendly with Snape, and the
more students get thrown out, the better, he'll think. And don't forget/забывать/,
we're not supposed/предполагаемый/ to know about the Stone or Fluffy/пушистый/. That'll take a lot
of explaining."

Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn't.

"If we just do a bit of poking around --"

"No," said Harry flatly, "we've done enough/достаточно/ poking around."

He pulled a map of Jupiter toward/к/ him and started to learn the names of
its moons.

The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and
Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:

Your detention will take place at eleven o'clock tonight. Meet Mr. Filch/стащить/
in the entrance hall.

Professor McGonagall Harry had forgotten/забытый/ they still/все еще/ had detentions to do
in the furor over the points they'd lost. He half expected/ожидаемый/ Hermione to
complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn't
say a word. Like Harry, she felt/почувствовал/ they deserved what they'd got.

At eleven o'clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common
room and went/отправился/ down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch/стащить/ was already
there -- and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten/забытый/ that Malfoy had
gotten/полученный/ a detention, too.

"Follow me," said Filch/стащить/, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.

I bet/делать ставку/ you'll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won/выиграл/'t you,
eh?" he said, leering at them. "Oh yes... hard work and pain/боль/ are the
best teachers if you ask me.... It's just a pity they let the old
punishments die out... hang/вешать/ you by your wrists from the ceiling/потолок/ for a
few days, I've got the chains still/все еще/ in my office, keep 'em/Эм/ well oiled in
case they're ever/Когда-либо/ needed.... Right, off we go, and don't think of
running off, now, it'll be worse/хуже/ for you if you do."

They marched off across/через/ the dark grounds/основания/. Neville kept/держали/ sniffing. Harry
wondered/задавались вопросом/ what their punishment was going to be. It must be something
really horrible/какой ужас/, or Filch/стащить/ wouldn't be sounding so delighted.

The moon was bright/яркий/, but clouds scudding across/через/ it kept/держали/ throwing/бросание/ them
into darkness. Ahead/впереди/, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid's
hut/хижина/. Then they heard/услышанным/ a distant shout.

"Is that you, Filch/стащить/? Hurry/торопиться/ up, I want ter/тер/ get started."

Harry's heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it
wouldn't be so bad. His relief must have showed in his -face, because
Filch/стащить/ said, "I suppose/предполагать/ you think you'll be enjoying yourself/сам/ with that
oaf? Well, think again, boy -- it's into the forest you're going and I'm
much mistaken if you'll all come out in one piece."

At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his
tracks.

"The forest?" he repeated, and he didn't sound quite/довольно/ as cool as usual.
"We can't go in there at night -- there's all sorts of things in there
-- werewolves, I heard/услышанным/."

Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry's robe and made a choking noise.

"That's your problem, isn't it?" said Filch/стащить/, his voice cracking with
glee. "Should've thought/думал/ of them werewolves before you got in trouble/беда/,
shouldn't you?"

Hagrid came striding toward/к/ them out of the dark, Fang/клык/ at his heel. He
was carrying/проведение/ his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung/висела/ over his
shoulder.

"Abou' time," he said. "I bin/бункер/ waitin' fer/фер/ half an hour already. All
right, Harry, Hermione?"

"I shouldn't be too friendly to them, Hagrid," said Filch/стащить/ coldly,
they're here to be punished, after all."

"That's why yer/Ер/ late, is it?" said Hagrid, frowning at Filch/стащить/. "Bin/бункер/
lecturin' them, eh? 'Snot your place ter/тер/ do that. Yeh've done yer/Ер/ bit,
I'll take over from here."

"I'll be back at dawn," said Filch/стащить/, "for what's left of them," he added
nastily, and he turned/оказалось/ and started back toward/к/ the castle, his lamp
bobbing away/далеко/ in the darkness.

Malfoy now turned/оказалось/ to Hagrid.

"I'm not going in that forest, he said, and Harry was pleased/довольный/ to hear
the note/заметка/ of panic in his voice.

"Yeh are if yeh want ter/тер/ stay at Hogwarts," said Hagrid fiercely.
"Yeh've done wrong/неправильно/ an' now yehve got ter/тер/ pay fer/фер/ it."

"But this is servant stuff/материал/, it's not for students to do. I thought/думал/ we'd
be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he'd

tell yer/Ер/ that's how it is at Hogwarts," Hagrid growled. "Copyin' lines!
What good's that ter/тер/ anyone/кто угодно/? Yeh'll do summat useful or Yeh'll get out.
If yeh think yer/Ер/ father'd rather/скорее/ you were expelled/исключенный/, then get back off
ter/тер/ the castle an' pack. Go on"'

Malfoy didn't move. He looked at Hagrid furiously/бешено/, but then dropped/упал/ his
gaze.

"Right then," said Hagrid, "now, listen carefully, 'cause it's dangerous
what we're gonna do tonight, an' I don' want no one takin' risks. Follow
me over here a moment."

He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he
pointed/заостренный/ down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared/исчез/ into the
thick/толстый/ black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into
the forest.

"Look there," said Hagrid, "see that stuff/материал/ shinin' on the ground/земля/?
Silvery stuff/материал/? That's unicorn/единорог/ blood. There's a unicorn/единорог/ in there bin/бункер/ hurt/причинить боль/
badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead
last Wednesday. We're gonna try an' find the poor thing. We might have
ter/тер/ put it out of its misery."

"And what if whatever/без разницы/ hurt/причинить боль/ the unicorn/единорог/ finds us first?" said Malfoy,
unable to keep the fear/страх/ out of his voice.

"There's nothin' that lives in the forest that'll hurt/причинить боль/ yeh if yer/Ер/ with
me or Fang/клык/," said Hagrid. "An' keep ter/тер/ the path. Right, now, we're
gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent
directions. There's blood all over the place, it must've bin/бункер/ staggerin'
around since last night at least/наименее/."

"I want Fang/клык/," said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang/клык/'s long teeth.

"All right, but I warn yeh, he's a coward," said Hagrid. " So me, Harry,
an' Hermione'll go one way an' Draco, Neville, an' Fang/клык/'ll go the other.
Now, if any of us finds the unicorn/единорог/, we'll send up green sparks, right?
Get yer/Ер/ wands/палочки/ out an' practice now -- that's it -- an' if anyone/кто угодно/ gets in
trouble/беда/, send up red sparks, an' we'll all come an' find yeh -- so, be
careful -- let's go."

The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached/достиг/ a
fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took/взял/ the left
path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang/клык/ took/взял/ the right.

They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground/земля/. Every now and then a
ray of moonlight through the branches above/выше/ lit a spot of silver-blue
blood on the fallen leaves.

Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.

"Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?" Harry asked.

"Not fast enough/достаточно/," said Hagrid. "It's not easy ter/тер/ catch/поймать/ a unicorn/единорог/,
they're powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter/тер/ be hurt/причинить боль/ before."

They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water;
there must be a stream somewhere/где-то/ close by. There were still/все еще/ spots of
unicorn/единорог/ blood here and there along/вдоль/ the winding path.

"You all right, Hermione?" Hagrid whispered/прошептал/. "Don' worry, it can't've
gone far if it's this badly hurt/причинить боль/, an' then we'll be able/в состоянии/ ter/тер/ -- GET
BEHIND/за/ THAT TREE!"

Hagrid seized/захватили/ Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind/за/ a
towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow,
raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was
slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing
along/вдоль/ the ground/земля/. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few
seconds, the sound faded away/далеко/.

"I knew it, " he murmured. "There's summat in here that shouldn' be."

"A werewolf?" Harry suggested.

"That wasn' no werewolf an' it wasn' no unicorn/единорог/, neither/ни/," said Hagrid
grimly. "Right, follow me, but careful, now."

They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound.
Suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/, in a clearing/клиринг/ ahead/впереди/, something definitely moved.

"Who's there?" Hagrid called. "Show yerself -- I'm armed!"

And into the clearing/клиринг/ came -- was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a
man, with red hair and beard/борода/, but below that was a horse's gleaming
chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione's jaws
dropped/упал/.

"Oh, it's you, Ronan," said Hagrid in relief. "How are yeh?"

He walked forward and shook/встряхнул/ the centaur's hand.

"Good evening to you, Hagrid," said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful
voice. "Were you going to shoot me?"

"Can't be too careful, Ronan," said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.
"There's summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an'
Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An' this is
Ronan, you two. He's a centaur.))

"We'd noticed/заметил/," said Hermione faintly.

"Good evening," said Ronan. "Students, are you? And do you learn much,
up at the school?"

"Erm --"

"A bit," said Hermione timidly.

"A bit. Well, that's something." Ronan sighed. He flung back his head
and stared at the sky. "Mars is bright/яркий/ tonight."

"Yeah," said Hagrid, glancing up, too. "Listen, I'm glad/довольный/ we've run inter
yeh, Ronan, 'cause there's a unicorn/единорог/ bin/бункер/ hurt/причинить боль/ -- you seen anythin/хоть что/'?"

Ronan didn't answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then
sighed again.

"Always the innocent are the first victims," he said. "So it has been
for ages past, so it is now."

"Yeah," said Hagrid, "but have yeh seen anythin/хоть что/', Ronan? Anythin/хоть что/'
unusual?"

"Mars is bright/яркий/ tonight," Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him
impatiently. "Unusually bright/яркий/."

"Yeah, but I was meanin' anythin/хоть что/' unusual a bit nearer/ближе/ home, said
Hagrid. "So yeh haven't noticed/заметил/ anythin/хоть что/' strange/странный/?"

Yet again, Ronan took/взял/ a while to answer. At last, he said, "The forest
hides many secrets."

A movement in the trees behind/за/ Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again,
but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and
wilder-looking than Ronan.

"Hullo, Bane/отрава/," said Hagrid. "All right?"

"Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?"

"Well enough/достаточно/. Look, I've jus' bin/бункер/ askin' Ronan, you seen anythin/хоть что/' odd/странный/ in
here lately? There's a unicorn/единорог/ bin/бункер/ injured -- would yeh know anythin/хоть что/'
about it?"

Bane/отрава/ walked over to stand/стоять/ next to Ronan. He looked skyward. "Mars is
bright/яркий/ tonight," he said simply.

"We've heard/услышанным/," said Hagrid grumpily. "Well, if either/или/ of you do see
anythin/хоть что/', let me know, won/выиграл/'t yeh? We'll be off, then."

Harry and Hermione followed/с последующим/ him out of the clearing/клиринг/, staring/уставившись/ over their
shoulders at Ronan and Bane/отрава/ until/до/ the trees blocked their view.

"Never," said Hagrid irritably, "try an' get a straight/Прямо/ answer out of a
centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin/хоть что/' closer/ближе/'n the
moon."

"Are there many of them in here?" asked Hermione.

"Oh, a fair few... Keep themselves/самих себя/ to themselves/самих себя/ mostly, but they're
good enough/достаточно/ about turnin' up if ever/Когда-либо/ I want a word. They're deep, mind/разум/,
centaurs... they know things... jus' don' let on much."

"D'you think that was a centaur we heard/услышанным/ earlier?" said Harry.

"Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what's
bin/бункер/ killin' the unicorns -- never heard/услышанным/ anythin/хоть что/' like it before."

They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept/держали/ looking
nervously/нервно/ over his shoulder. He had the nasty/противный/ feeling they were being/являющийся/
watched. He was very glad/довольный/ they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them.
They had just passed/прошло/ a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed/схватил/ Hagrid's
arm/рука/.

"Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble/беда/!"

"You two wait here!" Hagrid shouted/кричал/. "Stay on the path, I'll come back
for yeh!"

They heard/услышанным/ him crashing away/далеко/ through the undergrowth and stood/стоял/ looking
at each other, very scared/испуганный/, until/до/ they couldn't hear anything but the
rustling of leaves around them.

"You don't think they've been hurt/причинить боль/, do you?" whispered/прошептал/ Hermione.

"I don't care if Malfoy has, but if something's got Neville... it's our
fault he's here in the first place."

The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed/казалось/ sharper than usual. Harry's
seemed/казалось/ to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig.
What was going on? Where were the others?

At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid's return. Malfoy,
Neville, and Fang/клык/ were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed/казалось/,
had sneaked up behind/за/ Neville and grabbed/схватил/ him as a joke. Neville had
panicked and sent up the sparks.

"We'll be lucky/везучий/ ter/тер/ catch/поймать/ anythin/хоть что/' now, with the racket you two were
makin'. Right, we're changin' groups -- Neville, you stay with me an'
Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang/клык/ an' this idiot. I'm sorry," Hagrid
added in a whisper to Harry, "but he'll have a harder time frightenin'
you, an' we've gotta get this done."

So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang/клык/. They
walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until/до/
the path became/стал/ almost/почти/ impossible to follow because the trees were so
thick/толстый/. Harry thought/думал/ the blood seemed/казалось/ to be getting thicker. There were
splashes on the roots of a tree, as though/хоть/ the poor creature had been
thrashing around in pain/боль/ close by. Harry could see a clearing/клиринг/ ahead/впереди/,
through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.

"Look --" he murmured, holding out his arm/рука/ to stop Malfoy.

Something bright/яркий/ white was gleaming on the ground/земля/. They inched closer/ближе/.

It was the unicorn/единорог/ all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen
anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs/ноги/ were stuck out at
odd/странный/ angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on
the dark leaves.

Harry had taken/взятый/ one step toward/к/ it when a slithering sound made him
freeze where he stood/стоял/. A bush on the edge of the clearing/клиринг/ quivered....
Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across/через/ the
ground/земля/ like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang/клык/ stood/стоял/
transfixed. The cloaked figure reached/достиг/ the unicorn/единорог/, lowered its head
over the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink its blood.

"AAAAAAAAAARGH!"

Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted -- so did Fang/клык/. The hooded
figure raised/поднятый/ its head and looked right at Harry -- unicorn/единорог/ blood was
dribbling down its front. It got to its feet/ноги/ and came swiftly toward/к/
Harry -- he couldn't move for fear/страх/.

Then a pain/боль/ like he'd never felt/почувствовал/ before pierced his head; it was as
though/хоть/ his scar/шрам/ were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He
heard/услышанным/ hooves behind/за/ him, galloping, and something jumped clean over
Harry, charging at the figure.

The pain/боль/ in Harry's head was so bad he fell/упал/ to his knees/колени/. It took/взял/ a
minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur
was standing/постоянный/ over him, not Ronan or Bane/отрава/; this one looked younger; he
had white-blond hair and a palomino body.

"Are you all right?" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet/ноги/.

"Yes -- thank you -- what was that?"

The centaur didn't answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale/бледный/
sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar/шрам/
that stood/стоял/ out, livid, on Harry's forehead/лоб/.

"You are the Potter boy," he said. "You had better get back to Hagrid.
The forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you. Can you ride?
It will be quicker this way.

"My name is Firenze/Firenze/," he added, as he lowered himself/сам/ on to his front
legs/ноги/ so that Harry could clamber onto/на/ his back.

There was suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ a sound of more galloping from the other side of the
clearing/клиринг/. Ronan and Bane/отрава/ came bursting through the trees, their flanks
heaving and sweaty.

"Firenze/Firenze/!" Bane/отрава/ thundered. "What are you doing? You have a human on your
back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?"

"Do you realize who this is?" said Firenze/Firenze/. "This is the Potter boy. The
quicker he leaves this forest, the better."

"What have you been telling/говоря/ him?" growled Bane/отрава/. "Remember, Firenze/Firenze/, we
are sworn not to set ourselves against/против/ the heavens. Have we not read
what is to come in the movements of the planets?"

Ronan pawed the ground/земля/ nervously/нервно/. "I'm sure Firenze/Firenze/ thought/думал/ he was
acting for the best, " he said in his gloomy voice.

Bane/отрава/ kicked his back legs/ноги/ in anger.

"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with
what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like
donkeys after stray humans in our forest!"

Firenze/Firenze/ suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ reared on to his hind legs/ноги/ in anger, so that Harry had
to grab his shoulders to stay on.

"Do you not see that unicorn/единорог/?" Firenze/Firenze/ bellowed at Bane/отрава/. "Do you not
understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that
secret? I set myself against/против/ what is lurking in this forest, Bane/отрава/, yes,
with humans alongside me if I must."

And Firenze/Firenze/ whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could,
they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane/отрава/ behind/за/ them.

Harry didn't have a clue what was going on.

"Why's Bane/отрава/ so angry?" he asked. "What was that thing you saved me from,
anyway/так или иначе/?"

Firenze/Firenze/ slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of
low-hanging/подвешивание/ branches, but did not answer Harry's question. They made
their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought/думал/
Firenze/Firenze/ didn't want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a
particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze/Firenze/ suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/
stopped.

"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn/единорог/ blood is used -for?"

"No," said Harry, startled by the odd/странный/ question. "We've only used the
horn and tail hair in Potions/зелий/."

"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn/единорог/," said
Firenze/Firenze/. "Only one who has nothing to lose/потерять/, and everything/все/ to gain,
would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn/единорог/ will keep you alive,
even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have
slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself/сам/, and you will have
but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your
lips."

Harry stared at the back of Firenze/Firenze/'s head, which was dappled silver in
the moonlight.

"But who'd be that desperate?" he wondered/задавались вопросом/ aloud. "If you're going to be
cursed forever, deaths better, isn't it?"

"It is," Firenze/Firenze/ agreed/согласовано/, "unless/если/ all you need is to stay alive long
enough/достаточно/ to drink something else -- something that will bring you back to
full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die.
Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very
moment?"

"The Sorcerer's Stone! Of course -- the Elixir of Life! But I don't
understand who --"

"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power,
who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?"

It was as though/хоть/ an iron fist had clenched suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ around Harry's
heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed/казалось/ to hear once more what
Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: "Some say he died.
Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough/достаточно/ human left in him to
die."

"Do you mean," Harry croaked, "that was Vol-"

"Harry! Harry, are you all right?"

Hermione was running toward/к/ them down the path, Hagrid puffing along/вдоль/
behind/за/ her.

"I'm fine," said Harry, hardly knowing/знание/ what he was saying. "The
unicorn/единорог/'s dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing/клиринг/ back there."

"This is where I leave you," Firenze/Firenze/ murmured as Hagrid hurried/торопливый/ off to
examine the unicorn/единорог/. "You are safe now."

Harry slid off his back.

"Good luck, Harry Potter," said Firenze/Firenze/. "The planets have been read
wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those/те/
times."

He turned/оказалось/ and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry
shivering behind/за/ him.

Ron had fallen asleep/спящий/ in the dark common room, waiting for them to
return. He shouted/кричал/ something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly
shook/встряхнул/ him awake. In a matter/дело/ of seconds, though/хоть/, he was wide/широкий/-eyed as
Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.

Harry couldn't sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He
was still/все еще/ shaking/сотрясение/.

"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort... and Voldemort's waiting in the
forest... and all this time we thought/думал/ Snape just wanted to get
rich...."

"Stop saying the name!" said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he
thought/думал/ Voldemort could hear them.

Harry wasn't listening.

"Firenze/Firenze/ saved me, but he shouldn't have done so.... Bane/отрава/ was furious...
he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to
happen.... They must show that Voldemort's coming/приход/ back.... Bane/отрава/ thinks
Firenze/Firenze/ should have let Voldemort kill me.... I suppose/предполагать/ that's written
in the stars as well."

"Will you stop saying the name!" Ron hissed.

"So all I've got to wait for now is Snape to steal/украсть/ the Stone," Harry
went/отправился/ on feverishly, "then Voldemort will be able/в состоянии/ to come and finish me
off... Well, I suppose/предполагать/ Bane/отрава/'ll be happy."

Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.

"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was ever/Когда-либо/
afraid of With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won/выиграл/'t touch you. Anyway/так или иначе/,
who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling/говоря/ to me,
and Professor McGonagall says that's a very imprecise branch of magic."

The sky had turned/оказалось/ light before they stopped talking. They went/отправился/ to bed
exhausted, their throats sore. But the night's surprises weren't over.

When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak
folded neatly underneath/под/ them. There was a note/заметка/ pinned to it:

Just in case.


CHAPTER SIXTEEN

THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR/люк/

In years to come, Harry would never quite/довольно/ remember how he had managed/удалось/ to
get through his exams when he half expected/ожидаемый/ Voldemort to come bursting
through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept/подкрался/ by, and there could
be no doubt that Fluffy/пушистый/ was still/все еще/ alive and well behind/за/ the locked/запертый/ door.

It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did
their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the
exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell/орфографии/.

They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by
one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across/через/
a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox
-- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken/взятый/ away/далеко/ if
it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks
while they tried/пытался/ to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.

Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his
forehead/лоб/, which had been bothering him ever/Когда-либо/ since his trip into the
forest. Neville thought/думал/ Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because
Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept/держали/ being/являющийся/ woken by
his old nightmare, except/Кроме/ that it was now worse/хуже/ than ever/Когда-либо/ because there
was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.

Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest,
or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron
and Hermione didn't seem/казаться/ as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea
of Voldemort certainly scared/испуганный/ them, but he didn't keep visiting them in
dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much
time to fret about what Snape or anyone/кто угодно/ else might be up to.

Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering
questions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons
and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until/до/ their exam
results came out. When the ghost/призрак/ of Professor Binns told them to put
down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help
cheering with the rest/отдых/.

"That was far easier than I thought/думал/ it would be," said Hermione as they
joined/присоединился/ the crowds flocking out onto/на/ the sunny grounds/основания/. "I needn't have
learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of
Elfric the Eager."

Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron
said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and
flopped under a tree. The Weasley/Уизли/ twins/двойняшки/ and Lee Jordan were tickling the
tentacles of a giant/гигант/ squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. "No
more studying," Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. "You
could look more cheerful, Harry, we've got a week before we find out how
badly we've done, there's no need to worry yet."

Harry was rubbing his forehead/лоб/.

"I wish I knew what this means!" he burst/взрыв/ out angrily. "My scar/шрам/ keeps
hurting -- it's happened before, but never as often as this."

"Go to Madam Pomfrey/Помфрей/," Hermione suggested.

"I'm not ill," said Harry. "I think it's a warning... it means danger's
coming/приход/...."

Ron couldn't get worked up, it was too hot.

"Harry, relax, Hermione's right, the Stone's safe as long as
Dumbledore's around. Anyway/так или иначе/, we've never had any proof Snape found out
how to get past Fluffy/пушистый/. He nearly had his leg/нога/ ripped off once, he's not
going to try it again in a hurry/торопиться/. And Neville will play Quidditch for
England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down."

Harry nodded/кивнул/, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was
something he'd forgotten/забытый/ to do, something important. When he tried/пытался/ to
explain/объяснять/ this, Hermione said, "That's just the exams. I woke/просыпался/ up last
night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I
remembered/вспомнил/ we'd done that one."

Harry was quite/довольно/ sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do
with work, though/хоть/. He watched an owl/сова/ flutter toward/к/ the school across/через/
the bright/яркий/ blue sky, a note/заметка/ clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only
one who ever/Когда-либо/ sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore.
Hagrid would never tell anyone/кто угодно/ how to get past Fluffy/пушистый/... never... but --

Harry suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ jumped to his feet/ноги/.

"Where're you going?" said Ron sleepily.

"I've just thought/думал/ of something," said Harry. He had turned/оказалось/ white.
"We've got to go and see Hagrid, now."

"Why?" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.

"Don't you think it's a bit odd/странный/," said Harry, scrambling up the grassy
slope, "that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and
a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket/карман/? How
many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against/против/ wizard law?
Lucky/везучий/ they found Hagrid, don't you think? Why didn't I see it before?"

"What are you talking about?" said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across/через/ the
grounds/основания/ toward/к/ the forest, didn't answer.

Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and
sleeves were rolled/прокат/ up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.

"Hullo," he said, smiling. "Finished yer/Ер/ exams? Got time fer/фер/ a drink?"

"Yes, please," said Ron, but Harry cut him off.

"No, we're in a hurry/торопиться/. Hagrid, I've got to ask you something. You know
that night you won/выиграл/ Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards
with look like?"

"Dunno," said Hagrid casually, "he wouldn' take his cloak off."

He saw the three of them look stunned and raised/поднятый/ his eyebrows.

"It's not that unusual, yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head --
that's the pub down in the village. Mighta bin/бункер/ a dragon dealer, mightn'
he? I never saw his face, he kept/держали/ his hood up."

Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. "What did you talk to him
about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?"

"Mighta come up," said Hagrid, frowning as he tried/пытался/ to remember.
"Yeah... he asked what I did, an' I told him I was gamekeeper here....
He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took/взял/ after... so I told
him... an' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon... an'
then... I can' remember too well, 'cause he kept/держали/ buyin' me drinks....
Let's see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an' we could play
cards fer/фер/ it if I wanted... but he had ter/тер/ be sure I could handle it, he
didn' want it ter/тер/ go ter/тер/ any old home.... So I told him, after Fluffy/пушистый/, a
dragon would be easy..."

"And did he -- did he seem/казаться/ interested in Fluffy/пушистый/?" Harry asked, try ing
to keep his voice calm.

"Well -- yeah -- how many three-headed dogs d'yeh meet, even around
Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy/пушистый/'s a piece o' cake if yeh know how to
calm him down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight/Прямо/ off
ter/тер/ sleep --"

Hagrid suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ looked horrified.

"I shouldn'ta told yeh that!" he blurted out. "Forget/забывать/ I said it! Hey --
where're yeh goin'?"

Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until/до/ they
came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed/казалось/ very cold and gloomy
after the grounds/основания/.

"We've got to go to Dumbledore," said Harry. "Hagrid told that stranger
how to get past Fluffy/пушистый/, and it was either/или/ Snape or Voldemort under that
cloak -- it must've been easy, once he'd got Hagrid drunk. I just hope
Dumbledore believes us. Firenze/Firenze/ might back us up if Bane/отрава/ doesn't stop
him. Where's Dumbledore's office?"

They looked around, as if hoping/надеясь/ to see a sign pointing/указательный/ them in the
right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor
did they know anyone/кто угодно/ who had been sent to see him.

"We'll just have to --" Harry began, but a voice suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ rang across/через/
the hall.

"What are you three doing inside?"

It was Professor McGonagall, carrying/проведение/ a large pile/свая/ of books.

"We want to see Professor Dumbledore," said Hermione, rather/скорее/ bravely,
Harry and Ron thought/думал/.

"See Professor Dumbledore?" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though/хоть/
this was a very fishy thing to want to do. "Why?"

Harry swallowed -- now what?

"It's sort of secret," he said, but he wished at once he hadn't, because
Professor McGonagall's nostrils flared.

"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago," she said coldly. "He
received an urgent owl/сова/ from the Ministry of Magic and flew/полетели/ off for
London at once."

"He's gone?" said Harry frantically. "Now?"

"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many
demands on his time --

"But this is important."

"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic,
Potter.

"Look," said Harry, throwing/бросание/ caution to the winds, "Professor -- it's
about the Sorcerer's tone --"

Whatever/без разницы/ Professor McGonagall had expected/ожидаемый/, it wasn't that. The books
she was carrying/проведение/ tumbled out of her arms/оружие/, but she didn't pick them up.
"How do you know --?" she spluttered.

"Professor, I think -- I know -- that Sn- that someone/кто то/'s going to try
and steal/украсть/ the Stone. I've got to talk to Professor Dumbledore."

She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.

"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow," she said finally. I don't
know how you found out about the Stone, but rest/отдых/ assured, no one can
possibly steal/украсть/ it, it's too well protected."

"But Professor --"

"Potter, I know what I'm talking about," she said shortly. She bent/изогнутый/ down
and gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside and
enjoy the sunshine."

But they didn't.

"It's tonight," said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was
out of earshot. "Snape's going through the trapdoor/люк/ tonight. He's found
out everything/все/ he needs, and now he's got Dumbledore out of the way. He
sent that note/заметка/, I bet/делать ставку/ the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when
Dumbledore turns up."

"But what can we --"

Hermione gasped/ахнула/. Harry and Ron wheeled round.

Snape was standing/постоянный/ there.

"Good afternoon," he said smoothly.

They stared at him.

"You shouldn't be inside on a day like this," he said, with an odd/странный/,
twisted smile.

"We were --" Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.

"You want to be more careful," said Snape. "Hanging/подвешивание/ around

like this, people will think you're up to something. And Gryffindor
really can't afford to lose/потерять/ any more points, can it?"

Harry flushed. They turned/оказалось/ to go outside, but Snape called them back.

"Be warned, Potter -- any more nighttime wanderings and I will
personally make sure you are expelled/исключенный/. Good day to you."

He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.

Out on the stone steps, Harry turned/оказалось/ to the others.

"Right, here's what we've got to do," he whispered/прошептал/ urgently. "One of us
has got to keep an eye on Snape -- wait outside the staff room and
follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you'd better do that."

"Why me?"

"It's obvious," said Ron. "You can pretend to be waiting for Professor
Flitwick, you know." He put on a high voice, "'Oh Professor Flitwick,
I'm so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong/неправильно/....'"

"Oh, shut/закрыть/ up," said Hermione, but she agreed/согласовано/ to go and watch out for
Snape.

"And we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor/коридор/," Harry told Ron.
"Come on."

But that part of the plan didn't work. No sooner had they reached/достиг/ the
door separating Fluffy/пушистый/ from the rest/отдых/ of the school than Professor
McGonagall turned/оказалось/ up again and this time, she lost her temper.

"I suppose/предполагать/ you think you're harder to get past than a pack of
enchantments!" she stormed. "Enough/достаточно/ of this nonsense! If I hear you 've
come anywhere near here again, I'll take another fifty points from
Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley/Уизли/, from my own house!" Harry and Ron went/отправился/ back to
the common room, Harry had just said, "At least/наименее/ Hermione's on Snape's
tail," when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung/качнулся/ open and Hermione came
in.

"I'm sorry, Harry!" she wailed. "Snape came out and asked me what I was
doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went/отправился/ to get him,
and I've only just got away/далеко/, I don't know where Snape went/отправился/."

"Well, that's it then, isn't it?" Harry said.

The other two stared at him. He was pale/бледный/ and his eyes were glittering.

"I'm going out of here tonight and I'm going to try and get to the Stone
first."

"You're mad/Сумасшедший/!" said Ron.

"You can't!" said Hermione. "After what McGonagall and Snape have said?
You'll be expelled/исключенный/!"

"SO WHAP" Harry shouted/кричал/. "Don't you understand? If Snape gets hold of
the Stone, Voldemort's coming/приход/ back! Haven't you heard/услышанным/ what it was like
when he was trying to take over? There won/выиграл/'t be any Hogwarts to get
expelled/исключенный/ from! He'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark
Arts! Losing points doesn't matter/дело/ anymore, can't you see? D'you think
he'll leave you and your families alone/в одиночестве/ if Gryffindor wins the house
cup? If I get caught/пойманный/ before I can get to the Stone, well, I'll have to
go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it's
only dying a bit later than I would have, because I'm never going over
to the Dark Side! I'm going through that trapdoor/люк/ tonight and nothing
you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?"

He glared at them.

"You're right Harry," said Hermione in a small voice.

"I'll use the invisibility cloak," said Harry. "It's just lucky/везучий/ I got it
back."

"But will it cover all three of us?" said Ron.

"All -- all three of us?"

"Oh, come off it, you don't think we'd let you go alone/в одиночестве/?"

"Of course not," said Hermione briskly. "How do you think you'd get to
the Stone without us? I'd better go and took/взял/ through my books, there
might be something useful..."

"But if we get caught/пойманный/, you two will be expelled/исключенный/, too."

"Not if I can help it," said Hermione grimly. "Flitwick told me in
secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They're not
throwing/бросание/ me out after that."

After dinner the three of them sat/сидел/ nervously/нервно/ apart/Кроме/ in the common room.
Nobody bothered them; none/никто/ of the Gryffindors had anything to say to
Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn't been upset
by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping/надеясь/ to come
across/через/ one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry
and Ron didn't talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they
were about to do.

Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.

"Better get the cloak," Ron muttered/пробормотал/, as Lee Jordan finally left,
stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs/вверх по лестнице/ to their dark dormitory/общежитие/. He
putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell/упал/ on the flute Hagrid had
given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy/пушистый/ -- he didn't
feel much like singing.

He ran back down to the common room.

"We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of
us -- if Filch/стащить/ spots one of our feet/ноги/ wandering along/вдоль/ on its own --"

"What are you doing?" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville
appeared/появился/ from behind/за/ an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad/жаба/, who looked
as though/хоть/ he'd been making another bid for freedom.

"Nothing, Neville, nothing," said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak
behind/за/ his back.

Neville stared at their guilty faces.

"You're going out again," he said.

"No, no, no," said Hermione. "No, we're not. Why don't you go to bed,
Neville?"

Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn't afford
to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy/пушистый/ to sleep.

"You can't go out," said Neville, "you'll be caught/пойманный/ again. Gryffindor
will be in even more trouble/беда/."

"You don't understand," said Harry, "this is important."

But Neville was clearly steeling himself/сам/ to do something desperate.

I won/выиграл/'t let you do it," he said, hurrying to stand/стоять/ in front of the
portrait hole. "I'll -- I'll fight you!"

"Neville, "Ron exploded, "get away/далеко/ from that hole and don't be an idiot
--"

"Don't you call me an idiot!" said Neville. I don't think you should be
breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand/стоять/ up to
people!"

"Yes, but not to us," said Ron in exasperation. "Neville, you don't know
what you're doing."

He took/взял/ a step forward and Neville dropped/упал/ Trevor the toad/жаба/, who leapt/прыгнула/
out of sight/взгляд/.

"Go on then, try and hit me!" said Neville, raising his fists. "I'm
ready!"

Harry turned/оказалось/ to Hermione.

"Do something," he said desperately.

Hermione stepped/ступенчатый/ forward.

"Neville," she said, "I'm really, really sorry about this."

She raised/поднятый/ her wand/палочка/.

"Petrificus Totalus!" she cried, pointing/указательный/ it at Neville.

Neville's arms/оружие/ snapped/щелкнул/ to his sides. His legs/ноги/ sprang together. His whole
body rigid, he swayed where he stood/стоял/ and then fell/упал/ flat on his face,
stiff as a board.

Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville's jaws were jammed together so he
couldn't speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror/ужастик/.

"What've you done to him?" Harry whispered/прошептал/.

"It's the full Body-Bind," said Hermione miserably. "Oh, Neville, I'm so
sorry."

"We had to, Neville, no time to explain/объяснять/," said Harry.

"You'll understand later, Neville," said Ron as they stepped/ступенчатый/ over him
and pulled on the invisibility cloak.

But leaving Neville lying/лежащий/ motionless on the floor didn't feel like a
very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked
like Filch/стащить/, every distant breath/дыхание/ of wind sounded like Peeves swooping
down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs/лестница/, they spotted/пятнистый/ Mrs.
Norris/Norris/ skulking near the top.

"Oh, let's kick her, just this once," Ron whispered/прошептал/ in Harry's ear, but
Harry shook/встряхнул/ his head. As they climbed/поднялся/ carefully around her, Mrs. Norris/Norris/
turned/оказалось/ her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything.

They didn't meet anyone/кто угодно/ else until/до/ they reached/достиг/ the staircase/лестница/ up to the
third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that
people would trip.

"Who's there?" he said suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ as they climbed/поднялся/ toward/к/ him. He narrowed
his wicked black eyes. "Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are
you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?"

He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.

"Should call Filch/стащить/, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen."

Harry had a sudden/внезапный/ idea.

"Peeves," he said, in a hoarse whisper, "the Bloody Baron has his own
reasons for being/являющийся/ invisible."

Peeves almost/почти/ fell/упал/ out of the air in shock. He caught/пойманный/ himself/сам/ in time
and hovered about a foot off the stairs/лестница/.

"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir," he said greasily. "My
mistake, my mistake -- I didn't see you -- of course I didn't, you're
invisible -- forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir."

"I have business here, Peeves," croaked Harry. "Stay away/далеко/ from this
place tonight."

"I will, sir, I most certainly will," said Peeves, rising up in the air
again. "Hope your business goes/идет/ well, Baron, I'll not bother you."

And he scooted off

"Brilliant, Harry!" whispered/прошептал/ Ron.

A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor/коридор/
-- and the door was already ajar.

"Well, there you are," Harry said quietly/тихо/, "Snape's already got past
Fluffy/пушистый/."

Seeing the open door somehow/как-то/ seemed/казалось/ to impress upon all three of them
what was facing them. Underneath/под/ the cloak, Harry turned/оказалось/ to the other
two.

"If you want to go back, I won/выиграл/'t blame you," he said. "You can take the
cloak, I won/выиграл/'t need it now."

"Don't be stupid," said Ron.

"We're coming/приход/," said Hermione.

Harry pushed the door open.

As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of
the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though/хоть/ it
couldn't see them.

"What's that at its feet/ноги/?" Hermione whispered/прошептал/.

"Looks like a harp," said Ron. "Snape must have left it there."

"It must wake up the moment you stop playing," said Harry. "Well, here
goes/идет/..."

He put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew. It wasn't really a tune, but
from the first note/заметка/ the beast's eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew
breath/дыхание/. Slowly, the dog's growls ceased -- it tottered on its paws and
fell/упал/ to its knees/колени/, then it slumped to the ground/земля/, fast asleep/спящий/.

"Keep playing," Ron warned Harry as they slipped/поскользнулся/ out of the cloak and
crept/подкрался/ toward/к/ the trapdoor/люк/. They could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath/дыхание/
as they approached the giant/гигант/ heads/руководители/. "I think we'll be able/в состоянии/ to pull the
door open," said Ron, peering over the dog's back. "Want to go first,
Hermione?"

"No, I don't!"

"All right." Ron gritted his teeth and stepped/ступенчатый/ carefully over the dog's
legs/ноги/. He bent/изогнутый/ and pulled the ring of the trapdoor/люк/, which swung/качнулся/ up and
open.

"What can you see?" Hermione said anxiously.

"Nothing -- just black -- there's no way of climbing down, we'll just
have to drop."

Harry, who was still/все еще/ playing the flute, waved/махал/ at Ron to get his
attention and pointed/заостренный/ at himself/сам/.

"You want to go first? Are you sure?" said Ron. "I don't know how deep
this thing goes/идет/. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep/спящий/."

Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds' silence, the dog
growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell/упал/
back into its deep sleep.

Harry climbed/поднялся/ over it and looked down through the trapdoor/люк/. There was no
sign of the bottom.

He lowered himself/сам/ through the hole until/до/ he was hanging/подвешивание/ on by his
fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, "If anything happens to
me, don't follow. Go straight/Прямо/ to the owlery and send Hedwig/Хедвиг/ to
Dumbledore, right?"

"Right," said Ron.

"See you in a minute, I hope...

And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell/упал/ down, down,
down and -- FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed/высадился/ on
something soft. He sat/сидел/ up and felt/почувствовал/ around, his eyes not used to the
gloom. It felt/почувствовал/ as though/хоть/ he was sitting on some sort of plant/растение/.

"It's okay!" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp,
which was the open trapdoor/люк/, "it's a soft landing, you can jump!"

Ron followed/с последующим/ right away/далеко/. He landed/высадился/, sprawled next to Harry.

"What's this stuff/материал/?" were his first words.

"Dunno, some sort of plant/растение/ thing. I suppose/предполагать/ it's here to break the fall/падать/.
Come on, Hermione!"

The distant music stopped. There was a loud/громкий/ bark from the dog, but
Hermione had already jumped. She landed/высадился/ on Harry's other side.

"We must be miles under the school , she said.

"Lucky/везучий/ this plant/растение/ thing's here, really," said Ron.

"Lucky/везучий/!" shrieked Hermione. "Look at you both!"

She leapt/прыгнула/ up and struggled toward/к/ a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed/высадился/, the plant/растение/ had started to twist
snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs/ноги/
had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.

Hermione had managed/удалось/ to free herself before the plant/растение/ got a firm grip on
her. Now she watched in horror/ужастик/ as the two boys fought to pull the plant/растение/
off them, but the more they strained against/против/ it, the tighter and faster
the plant/растение/ wound around them.

"Stop moving!" Hermione ordered them. "I know what this is -- it's
Devil's Snare!"

"Oh, I'm so glad/довольный/ we know what it's called, that's a great help," snarled
Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant/растение/ from curling around his
neck/шея/. "Shut/закрыть/ up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!" said Hermione.

"Well, hurry/торопиться/ up, I can't breathe!" Harry gasped/ахнула/, wrestling with it as it
curled around his chest.

"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it
likes the dark and the damp

"So light a fire!" Harry choked.

"Yes -- of course -- but there's no wood!" Hermione cried, wringing her
hands.

"HAVE YOU GONE MAD/Сумасшедший/?" Ron bellowed. "ARE YOU A WITCH/ведьма/ OR NOT?"

"Oh, right!" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand/палочка/, waved/махал/ it,
muttered/пробормотал/ something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had
used on Snape at the plant/растение/. In a matter/дело/ of seconds, the two boys felt/почувствовал/ it
loosening its grip as it cringed away/далеко/ from the light and warmth.
Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they
were able/в состоянии/ to pull free.

"Lucky/везучий/ you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione," said Harry as he
joined/присоединился/ her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.

"Yeah," said Ron, "and lucky/везучий/ Harry doesn't lose/потерять/ his head in a crisis --
'there's no wood,' honestly."

"This way," said Harry, pointing/указательный/ down a stone passageway, which was the
only way forward.

All they could hear apart/Кроме/ from their footsteps was the gentle drip of
water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and
Harry was reminded/напомнил/ of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart,
he remembered/вспомнил/ the dragons said to be guarding/охранные/ vaults in the wizards'
bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert had been bad
enough/достаточно/...

"Can you hear something?" Ron whispered/прошептал/.

Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed/казалось/ to be coming/приход/ from up
ahead/впереди/.

"Do you think it's a ghost/призрак/?"

"I don't know... sounds like wings to me."

"There's light ahead/впереди/ -- I can see something moving."

They reached/достиг/ the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly
lit chamber/камера/, its ceiling/потолок/ arching high above/выше/ them. It was full of small,
jewel-bright/яркий/ birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the
opposite side of the chamber/камера/ was a heavy wooden door.

"Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?" said Ron.

"Probably/вероятно/," said Harry. "They don't look very vicious, but I suppose/предполагать/ if
they all swooped down at once... well, there's no other choice... I'll
run."

He took/взял/ a deep breath/дыхание/, covered his face with his arms/оружие/, and sprinted
across/через/ the room. He expected/ожидаемый/ to feel sharp/резкое/ beaks and claws tearing at
him any second, but nothing happened. He reached/достиг/ the door untouched. He
pulled the handle, but it was locked/запертый/.

The other two followed/с последующим/ him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it
wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried/пытался/ her Alohomora charm.

"Now what?" said Ron.

"These/эти/ birds... they can't be here just for decoration," said Hermione.

They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering?

"They're not birds!" Harry said suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/. "They're keys! Winged keys --
look carefully. So that must mean..." he looked around the chamber/камера/ while
the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. "... yes -- look!
Broomsticks! We've got to catch/поймать/ the key to the door!"

"But there are hundreds of them!"

Ron examined the lock on the door.

"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably/вероятно/ silver, like the
handle."

They each seized/захватили/ a broomstick/метловище/ and kicked off into the air, soaring into
the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed/схватил/ and snatched, but the
bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost/почти/ impossible to
catch/поймать/ one.

Not for nothing, though/хоть/, was Harry the youngest Seeker/искатель/ in a century. He
had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's
weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed/заметил/ a large
silver key that had a bent/изогнутый/ wing, as if it had already been caught/пойманный/ and
stuffed roughly into the keyhole.

"That one!" he called to the others. "That big one -- there -- no, there
-- with bright/яркий/ blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side."

Ron went/отправился/ speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing/указательный/, crashed into
the ceiling/потолок/, and nearly fell/упал/ off his broom/метла/.

"We've got to close in on it!" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the
key with the damaged wing. "Ron, you come at it from above/выше/ -- Hermione,
stay below and stop it from going down and I'll try and catch/поймать/ it. Right,
NOW!"

Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry
streaked after it; it sped toward/к/ the wall, Harry leaned/подался/ forward and
with a nasty/противный/, crunching noise, pinned it against/против/ the stone with one
hand. Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber/камера/.

They landed/высадился/ quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in
his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned/оказалось/ -- it worked. The moment
the lock had clicked open, the key took/взял/ flight again, looking very
battered now that it had been caught/пойманный/ twice.

"Ready?" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They
nodded/кивнул/. He pulled the door open.

The next chamber/камера/ was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as
they stepped/ступенчатый/ into it, light suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ flooded the room to reveal an
astonishing sight/взгляд/.

They were standing/постоянный/ on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind/за/ the black
chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what
looked like black stone. Facing them, way across/через/ the chamber/камера/, were the
white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -- the towering
white chessmen had no faces.

"Now what do we do?" Harry whispered/прошептал/.

"It's obvious, isn't it?" said Ron. "We've got to play our way across/через/
the room."

Behind/за/ the white pieces they could see another door.

"How?" said Hermione nervously/нервно/.

"I think," said Ron, "we're going to have to be chessmen."

He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the
knight's horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the
ground/земля/ and the knight turned/оказалось/ his helmeted head to look down at Ron.

"Do we -- er/эр/ -- have to join you to get across/через/?" The black knight
nodded/кивнул/. Ron turned/оказалось/ to the other two.

"This needs thinking about 	he said. I suppose/предполагать/ we've got to take the
place of three of the black pieces...."

Harry and Hermione stayed quiet/тихо/, watching Ron think. Finally he said,
"Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither/ни/ of you are that good at
chess --"

"We're not offended," said Harry quickly. "Just tell us what to do."

"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, YOU 90
next to him instead of that castle."

"What about you?"

"I'm going to be a knight," said Ron.

The chessmen seemed/казалось/ to have been listening, because at these/эти/ words a
knight, a bishop, and a castle turned/оказалось/ their backs on the white pieces
and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron,
and Hermione took/взял/.

"White always plays first in chess," said Ron, peering across/через/ the board.
"Yes... look..."

A white pawn had moved forward two squares.

Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he
sent them. Harry's knees/колени/ were trembling. What if they lost?

"Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right."

Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken/взятый/. The white
queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he
lay/прокладывать/ quite/довольно/ still/все еще/, facedown.

"Had to let that happen," said Ron, looking shaken. "Leaves you free to
take that bishop, Hermione, go on."

Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.
Soon/скоро/ there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along/вдоль/ the wall.
Twice, Ron only just noticed/заметил/ in time that Harry and Hermione were in
danger. He himself/сам/ darted around the board, taking almost/почти/ as many white
pieces as they had lost black ones/те,/.

"We're nearly there," he muttered/пробормотал/ suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/. "Let me think let me
think..."

The white queen turned/оказалось/ her blank face toward/к/ him.

"Yes..." said Ron softly, "It's the only way... I've got to be taken/взятый/."

"NOF Harry and Hermione shouted/кричал/.

"That's chess!" snapped/щелкнул/ Ron. "You've got to make some sacrifices! I take
one step forward and she'll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate
the king, Harry!"

"But --"

"Do you want to stop Snape or not?"

"Ron --"

"Look, if you don't hurry/торопиться/ up, he'll already have the Stone!"

There was no alternative.

"Ready?" Ron called, his face pale/бледный/ but determined. "Here I go - now,
don't hang/вешать/ around once you've won/выиграл/."

He stepped/ступенчатый/ forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard
across/через/ the head with her stone arm/рука/, and he crashed to the floor -
Hermione screamed/кричал/ but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged Ron
to one side. He looked as if he'd been knocked/постучался/ out.

Shaking/сотрясение/, Harry moved three spaces to the left.

The white king took/взял/ off his crown and threw/бросил/ it at Harry's feet/ноги/. They had
won/выиграл/. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead/впереди/ clear. With
one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through
the door and up the next passageway.

"What if he's --?"

"He'll be all right," said Harry, trying to convince himself/сам/. "What do
you reckon's next?"

"We've had Sprout's, that was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put
charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them
alive; that leaves Quirrell's spell/орфографии/, and Snape's."

They had reached/достиг/ another door.

"All right?" Harry whispered/прошептал/.

"Go on."

Harry pushed it open.

A disgusting smell/запах/ filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their
robes/робы/ up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in
front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out
cold with a bloody lump on its head.

"I'm glad/довольный/ we didn't have to fight that one," Harry whispered/прошептал/ as they
stepped/ступенчатый/ carefully over one of its massive legs/ноги/. "Come on, I can't
breathe."

He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what
came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table
with seven differently shaped bottles standing/постоянный/ on it in a line.

"Snape's," said Harry. "What do we have to do?"

They stepped/ступенчатый/ over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind/за/
them in the doorway. It wasn't ordinary fire either/или/; it was purple/пурпурный/. At
the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward.
They were trapped.

"Look!" Hermione seized/захватили/ a roll of paper lying/лежащий/ next to the bottles. Harry
looked over her shoulder to read it:

Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind/за/,

Two of us will help you, which ever/Когда-либо/ you would find,

One among us seven will let you move ahead/впереди/,

Another will transport the drinker back instead,

Two among our number hold only nettle wine,

Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.

Choose, unless/если/ you wish to stay here forevermore,

To help you in your choice, we give you these/эти/ clues four:

First, however slyly the poison tries to hide

You will always find some on nettle wine's left side;

Second, different are those/те/ who stand/стоять/ at either/или/ end,

But if you would move onward, neither/ни/ is your friend;

Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,

Neither/ни/ dwarf nor giant/гигант/ holds death in their insides;

Fourth, the second left and the second on the right

Are twins/двойняшки/ once you taste them, though/хоть/ different at first sight/взгляд/.

Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was
smiling, the very last thing he felt/почувствовал/ like doing.

"Brilliant," said Hermione. "This isn't magic -- it's logic -- a puzzle.
A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be
stuck in here forever."

"But so will we, won/выиграл/'t we?" "Of course not," said Hermione. "Everything/все/
we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are
wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us
back through the purple/пурпурный/."

"But how do we know which to drink?"

"Give me a minute."

Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the
line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing/указательный/ at them. At last, she
clapped/захлопала/ her hands.

"Got it," she said. "The smallest bottle/бутылка/ will get us through the black
fire -- toward/к/ the Stone."

Harry looked at the tiny/крошечный/ bottle/бутылка/.

"There's only enough/достаточно/ there for one of us," he said. "That's hardly one
swallow."

They looked at each other.

"Which one will get you back through the purple/пурпурный/ flames?"

Hermione pointed/заостренный/ at a rounded bottle/бутылка/ at the right end of the line.

"You drink that," said Harry. "No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab
brooms/веники/ from the flying- key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor/люк/
and past Fluffy/пушистый/ -- go straight/Прямо/ to the owlery and send Hedwig/Хедвиг/ to
Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able/в состоянии/ to hold Snape off for a while,
but I'm no match for him, really."

"But Harry -- what if You-Know-Who's with him?"

"Well -- I was lucky/везучий/ once, wasn't I?" said Harry, pointing/указательный/ at his scar/шрам/.
"I might get lucky/везучий/ again."

Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ dashed at Harry and threw/бросил/ her
arms/оружие/ around him.

"Hermione!"

"Harry -- you're a great wizard, you know."

"I'm not as good as you," said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of
him.

"Me!" said Hermione. "Books! And cleverness! There are more important
things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be careful!"

"You drink first," said Harry. "You are sure which is which, aren't
you?"

"Positive," said Hermione. She took/взял/ a long drink from the round bottle/бутылка/
at the end, and shuddered.

"It's not poison?" said Harry anxiously.

"No -- but it's like ice."

"Quick, go, before it wears off."

"Good luck -- take care."

"GO!"

Hermione turned/оказалось/ and walked straight/Прямо/ through the purple/пурпурный/ fire.

Harry took/взял/ a deep breath/дыхание/ and picked/выбрал/ up the smallest bottle/бутылка/. He turned/оказалось/ to
face the black flames.

"Here I come," he said, and he drained the little bottle/бутылка/ in one gulp.

It was indeed/в самом деле/ as though/хоть/ ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle/бутылка/
down and walked forward; he braced himself/сам/, saw the black flames licking
his body, but couldn't feel them -- for a moment he could see nothing
but dark fire -- then he was on the other side, in the last chamber/камера/.

There was already someone/кто то/ there -- but it wasn't Snape. It wasn't even
Voldemort.


CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

THE MAN WITH TWO FACES

It was Quirrell.

"You!" gasped/ахнула/ Harry.

Quirrell smiled. His face wasn't twitching at all.

"Me," he said calmly. "I wondered/задавались вопросом/ whether I'd be meeting you here,
Potter."

"But I thought/думал/ -- Snape --"

"Severus?" Quirrell laughed, and it wasn't his usual quivering treble,
either/или/, but cold and sharp/резкое/. "Yes, Severus does seem/казаться/ the type, doesn't
he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to
him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?"

Harry couldn't take it in. This couldn't be true, it couldn't.

"But Snape tried/пытался/ to kill me!"

"No, no, no. I tried/пытался/ to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally
knocked/постучался/ me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch
match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I'd
have got you off that broom/метла/. I'd have managed/удалось/ it before then if Snape
hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you."

"Snape was trying to save me?"

"Of course," said Quirrell coolly. "\Why do you think he wanted to
referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn't do it
again. Funny, really... he needn't have bothered. I couldn't do anything
with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought/думал/ Snape was
trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself/сам/ unpopular...
and what a waste of time, when after all that, I'm going to kill you
tonight."

Quirrell snapped/щелкнул/ his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin/тонкий/ air and wrapped
themselves/самих себя/ tightly around Harry.

"You're too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on
Halloween like that, for all I knew you'd seen me coming/приход/ to look at what
was guarding/охранные/ the Stone."

"You let the troll in?"

"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what
I did to the one in the chamber/камера/ back there? Unfortunately, while
everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already
suspected me, went/отправился/ straight/Прямо/ to the third floor to head me off -- and not
only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog
didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg/нога/ off properly.

"Now, wait quietly/тихо/, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.

It was only then that Harry realized what was standing/постоянный/ behind/за/ Quirrell.
It was the Mirror of Erised.

"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone," Quirrell murmured,
tapping his way around the frame. "Trust Dumbledore to come up with
something like this... but he's in London... I'll be far away/далеко/ by the
time he gets back...."

All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
from concentrating on the mirror.

"I saw you and Snape in the forest --" he blurted out.

"Yes," said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the
back. "He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I'd got.
He suspected me all along/вдоль/. Tried/пытался/ to frighten me - as though/хоть/ he could,
when I had Lord Voldemort on my side...."

Quirrell came back out from behind/за/ the mirror and stared hungrily into
it.

"I see the Stone... I'm presenting it to my master... but where is it?"

Harry struggled against/против/ the ropes binding him, but they didn't give. He
had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.

"But Snape always seemed/казалось/ to hate me so much."

"Oh, he does," said Quirrell casually, "heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts
with your father, didn't you know? They loathed each other. But he never
wanted you dead."

"But I heard/услышанным/ you a few days ago, sobbing -- I thought/думал/ Snape was
threatening you...."

For the first time, a spasm of fear/страх/ flitted across/через/ Quirrell's face.

"Sometimes," he said, "I find it hard to follow my master's instructions
-- he is a great wizard and I am weak --"

"You mean he was there in the classroom with you?" Harry gasped/ахнула/.

"He is with me wherever I go," said Quirrell quietly/тихо/. "I met him when I
traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of
ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong/неправильно/
I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those/те/ too
weak to seek it.... Since then, I have served him faithfully, although/несмотря на то что/ I
have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me."
Quirrell shivered suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/. "He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I
failed to steal/украсть/ the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He
punished me... decided/приняли решение/ he would have to keep a closer/ближе/ watch on me...."

Quirrell's voice trailed away/далеко/. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon
Alley -how could he have been so stupid? He'd seen Quirrell there that
very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky/неплотный/ Cauldron/котел/.

Quirrell cursed under his breath/дыхание/.

"I don't understand... is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break
it?"

Harry's mind/разум/ was racing.

What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he
thought/думал/, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the
mirror, I should see myseff finding it -- which means I'll see where
it's hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I'm up
to?

He tried/пытался/ to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without
Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he
tripped and fell/упал/ over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still/все еще/ talking to
himself/сам/. "What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!"

And to Harry's horror/ужастик/, a voice answered, and the voice seemed/казалось/ to come
from Quirrell himself/сам/

"Use the boy... Use the boy..."

Quirrell rounded on Harry.

"Yes -- Potter -- come here."

He clapped/захлопала/ his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell/упал/ off. Harry
got slowly to his feet/ноги/.

"Come here," Quirrell repeated. "Look in the mirror and tell me what you
see."

Harry walked toward/к/ him.

I must lie, he thought/думал/ desperately. I must look and lie about what I
see, that's all.

Quirrell moved close behind/за/ him. Harry breathed in the funny smell/запах/ that
seemed/казалось/ to come from Quirrell's turban. He closed his eyes, stepped/ступенчатый/ in
front of the mirror, and opened them again.

He saw his reflection, pale/бледный/ and scared/испуганный/-looking at first. But a moment
later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket/карман/ and
pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its
pocket/карман/ -- and as it did so, Harry felt/почувствовал/ something heavy drop into his
real pocket/карман/. Somehow/как-то/ -- incredibly -- he'd gotten/полученный/ the Stone.

"Well?" said Quirrell impatiently. "What do you see?"

Harry screwed up his courage.

"I see myself shaking/сотрясение/ hands with Dumbledore," he invented. "I -- I've
won/выиграл/ the house cup for Gryffindor."

Quirrell cursed again.

"Get out of the way," he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt/почувствовал/ the
Sorcerer's Stone against/против/ his leg/нога/. Dare/сметь/ he make a break for it?

But he hadn't walked five paces before a high voice spoke/говорил/, though/хоть/
Quirrell wasn't moving his lips.

"He lies... He lies..."

"Potter, come back here!" Quirrell shouted/кричал/. "Tell me the truth! What did
you just see?"

The high voice spoke/говорил/ again.

"Let me speak to him... face-to-face..."

"Master, you are not strong enough/достаточно/!"

"I have strength enough/достаточно/... for this...."

Harry felt/почувствовал/ as if Devil's Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn't
move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached/достиг/ up and began to
unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell/упал/ away/далеко/. Quirrell's
head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned/оказалось/ slowly on the
spot.

Harry would have screamed/кричал/, but he couldn't make a sound. Where there
should have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most
terrible face Harry had ever/Когда-либо/ seen. It was chalk white with glaring red
eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.

"Harry Potter..." it whispered/прошептал/.

Harry tried/пытался/ to take a step backward but his legs/ноги/ wouldn't move.

"See what I have become?" the face said. "Mere shadow and vapor ... I
have form only when I can share another's body... but there have always
been those/те/ willing to let me into their hearts and minds.... Unicorn/единорог/
blood has strengthened me, these/эти/ past weeks... you saw faithful Quirrell
drinking it for me in the forest... and once I have the Elixir of Life,
I will be able/в состоянии/ to create a body of my own.... Now... why don't you give
me that Stone in your pocket/карман/?"

So he knew. The feeling suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/ surged back into Harry's legs/ноги/. He
stumbled backward.

"Don't be a fool," snarled the face. "Better save your own life and join
me... or you'll meet the same end as your parents.... They died begging
me for mercy..."

"LIAR!" Harry shouted/кричал/ suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/.

Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still/все еще/ see
him. The evil face was now smiling.

"How touching..." it hissed. "I always value bravery... Yes, boy, your
parents were brave.... I killed your father first; and he put up a
courageous fight... but your mother needn't have died... she was trying
to protect you.... Now give me the Stone, unless/если/ you want her to have
died in vain."

"NEVER!"

Harry sprang toward/к/ the flame door, but Voldemort screamed/кричал/ "SEIZE HIM!"
and the next second, Harry felt/почувствовал/ Quirrell's hand close on his wrist. At
once, a needle-sharp/резкое/ pain/боль/ seared across/через/ Harry's scar/шрам/; his head felt/почувствовал/ as
though/хоть/ it was about to split in two; he yelled/вопил/, struggling with all his
might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain/боль/ in his head
lessened -- he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and
saw him hunched in pain/боль/, looking at his fingers -- they were blistering
before his eyes.

"Seize him! SEIZE HIM!" shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged,
knocking Harry clean off his feet/ноги/' landing on top of him, both hands
around Harry's neck/шея/ -- Harry's scar/шрам/ was almost/почти/ blinding him with pain/боль/,
yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.

"Master, I cannot hold him -- my hands -- my hands!"

And Quirrell, though/хоть/ pinning Harry to the ground/земля/ with his knees/колени/, let go
of his neck/шея/ and stared, bewildered, at his own palms -- Harry could see
they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.

"Then kill him, fool, and be done!" screeched Voldemort.

Quirrell raised/поднятый/ his hand to perform a deadly curse/проклятие/, but Harry, by
instinct, reached/достиг/ up and grabbed/схватил/ Quirrell's face --

"AAAARGH!"

Quirrell rolled/прокат/ off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew:
Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible
pain/боль/ -- his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough/достаточно/
pain/боль/ to stop him from doing a curse/проклятие/.

Harry jumped to his feet/ноги/, caught/пойманный/ Quirrell by the arm/рука/, and hung/висела/ on as
tight as he could. Quirrell screamed/кричал/ and tried/пытался/ to throw Harry off -- the
pain/боль/ in Harry's head was building -- he couldn't see -- he could only
hear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's yells of, "KILL HIM!
KILL HIM!" and other voices, maybe in Harry's own head, crying, "Harry!
Harry!"

He felt/почувствовал/ Quirrell's arm/рука/ wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and
fell/упал/ into blackness, down ... down... down...

Something gold was glinting just above/выше/ him. The Snitch/доносчик/! He tried/пытался/ to
catch/поймать/ it, but his arms/оружие/ were too heavy.

He blinked. It wasn't the Snitch/доносчик/ at all. It was a pair of glasses. How
strange/странный/.

He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view
above/выше/ him.

"Good afternoon, Harry," said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he
remembered/вспомнил/: "Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He's got the Stone! Sir,
quick --"

"Calm yourself/сам/, dear boy, you are a little behind/за/ the times," said
Dumbledore. "Quirrell does not have the Stone."

"Then who does? Sir, I --"

"Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey/Помфрей/ will have me thrown out.

Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the
hospital wing. He was lying/лежащий/ in a bed with white linen sheets, and next
to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.

"Tokens from your friends and admirers," said Dumbledore, beaming. "What
happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a
complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe/верить/ your
friends Misters Fred and George Weasley/Уизли/ were responsible for trying to
send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought/думал/ it would amuse you. Madam
Pomfrey/Помфрей/, however, felt/почувствовал/ it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated
it."

"How long have I been in here?"

"Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley/Уизли/ and Miss Granger will be most relieved
you have come round, they have been extremely worried."

"But sit, the Stone

I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor
Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to
prevent that, although/несмотря на то что/ you were doing very well on your own, I must say.

"You got there? You got Hermione's owl/сова/?"

"We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached/достиг/ London than it
became/стал/ clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just
left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you."

"It was you."

"I feared I might be too late."

"You nearly were, I couldn't have kept/держали/ him off the Stone much longer --"

"Not the Stone, boy, you -- the effort involved nearly killed you. For
one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has
been destroyed."

"Destroyed?" said Harry blankly. "But your friend -- Nicolas Flamel/Фламель/ --"

"Oh, you know about Nicolas?" said Dumbledore, sounding quite/довольно/ delighted.
"You did do the thing properly, didn't you? Well, Nicolas and I have had
a little chat, and agreed/согласовано/ it's all for the best."

"But that means he and his wife will die, won/выиграл/'t they?"

"They have enough/достаточно/ Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then,
yes, they will die."

Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry's face.

"To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas
and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long
day. After all, to the well-organized mind/разум/, death is but the next great
adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As
much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings
would choose above/выше/ all -- the trouble/беда/ is, humans do have a knack of
choosing precisely those/те/ things that are worst for them." Harry lay/прокладывать/
there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the
ceiling/потолок/.

"Sir?" said Harry. "I've been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone's
gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know- Who --"

"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear/страх/
of a name increases fear/страх/ of the thing itself."

"Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort's going to try other ways of coming/приход/ back,
isn't he? I mean, he hasn't gone, has he?"

"No, Harry, he has not. He is still/все еще/ out there somewhere/где-то/, perhaps looking
for another body to share... not being/являющийся/ truly alive, he cannot be killed.
He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers
as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his
return to power, it will merely take someone/кто то/ else who is prepared to
fight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if he is delayed
again, and again, why, he may never return to power."

Harry nodded/кивнул/, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt/причинить боль/. Then
he said, "Sir, there are some other things I'd like to know, if you can
tell me... things I want to know the truth about...."

"The truth." Dumbledore sighed. "It is a beautiful and terrible thing,
and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall
answer your questions unless/если/ I have a very good reason not to, in which
case I beg you'll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie."

"Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried/пытался/
to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the
first place?"

Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.

"Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not
now. You will know, one day... put it from your mind/разум/ for now, Harry.
When you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are
ready, you will know."

And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.

"But why couldn't Quirrell touch me?"

"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot
understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your
mother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar/шрам/, no visible sign... to
have been loved so deeply, even though/хоть/ the person who loved us is gone,
will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell,
full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort,
could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person
marked by something so good."

Dumbledore now became/стал/ very interested in a bird out on the windowsill,
which gave/дал/ Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found
his voice again, Harry said, "And the invisibility cloak - do you know
who sent it to me?"

"Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought/думал/
you might like it." Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "Useful things... your
father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal/украсть/ food
when he was here."

"And there's something else..."

"Fire away/далеко/."

"Quirrell said Snape --"

"Professor Snape, Harry." "Yes, him -- Quirrell said he hates me because
he hated my father. Is that true?"

"Well, they did rather/скорее/ detest each other. Not unlike yourself/сам/ and Mr.
Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive."

"What?"

"He saved his life."

"What?"

"Yes..." said Dumbledore dreamily. "Funny, the way people's minds work,
isn't it? Professor Snape couldn't bear being/являющийся/ in your father's debt....
I do believe/верить/ he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt/почувствовал/
that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to
hating your father's memory in peace...."

Harry tried/пытался/ to understand this but it made his head pound, so he
stopped.

"And sir, there's one more thing..."

"Just the one?"

"How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?"

"Ah, now, I'm glad/довольный/ you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant
ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something. You see, only
one who wanted to find the Stone -- find it, but not use it -- would be
able/в состоянии/ to get it, otherwise they'd just see themselves/самих себя/ making gold or
drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes.... Now,
enough/достаточно/ questions. I suggest you make a start on these/эти/ sweets. Ah! Bettie
Bott's Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough/достаточно/ in my youth to come
across/через/ a vomitflavored one, and since then I'm afraid I've rather/скорее/ lost
my liking for them -- but I think I'll be safe with a nice toffee, don't
you?"

He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he
choked and said, "Alas! Ear wax!"

Madam Pomfrey/Помфрей/, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.

"Just five minutes," Harry pleaded.

"Absolutely not."

"You let Professor Dumbledore in..."

"Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite/довольно/ different. You need
rest/отдых/."

"I am resting, look, lying/лежащий/ down and everything/все/. Oh, go on, Madam
Pomfrey/Помфрей/..."

"Oh, very well," she said. "But five minutes only."

And she let Ron and Hermione in.

"Harry!"

Hermione looked ready to fling her arms/оружие/ around him again, but Harry was
glad/довольный/ she held/Ручной/ herself in as his head was still/все еще/ very sore.

"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to -- Dumbledore was so worried
--"

"The whole school's talking about it," said Ron. "What really happened?"

It was one of those/те/ rare occasions when the true story is even more
strange/странный/ and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything/все/:
Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a
very good audience; they gasped/ахнула/ in all the right places, and when Harry
told them what was under Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed/кричал/ out loud/громкий/.

"So the Stone's gone?" said Ron finally. "Flamel/Фламель/'s just going to die?"

"That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that -- what was it? -- 'to
the well-organized mind/разум/, death is but the next great adventure.

"I always said he was off his rocker," said Ron, looking quite/довольно/ impressed
at how crazy his hero was.

"So what happened to you two?" said Harry.

"Well, I got back all right," said Hermione. "I brought/привел/ Ron round --
that took/взял/ a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact
Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew -- he
just said, 'Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?' and hurtled off to the
third floor."

"D'you think he meant you to do it?" said Ron. "Sending you your
father's cloak and everything/все/?"

"Well, " Hermione exploded, "if he did -- I mean to say that's terrible
-- you could have been killed."

"No, it isn't," said Harry thoughtfully. "He's a funny man, Dumbledore.
I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or
less everything/все/ that goes/идет/ on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty
good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just
taught us enough/достаточно/ to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me
find out how the mirror worked. It's almost/почти/ like he thought/думал/ I had the
right to face Voldemort if I could...."

"Yeah, Dumbledore's off his rocker, all right," said Ron proudly.
"Listen, you've got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The
points are all in and Slytherin won/выиграл/, of course -- you missed the last
Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw/Рейвенкло/ without you -- but
the food'll be good."

At that moment, Madam Pomfrey/Помфрей/ bustled over.

"You've had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT" she said firmly.

After a good night's sleep, Harry felt/почувствовал/ nearly back to normal.

I want to go to the feast," he told Madam Pomfrey/Помфрей/ as she straightened
his many candy boxes. I can, can't I?"

"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go," she said
stiffily, as though/хоть/ in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn't realize
how risky feasts could be. "And you have another visitor."

"Oh, good," said Harry. "Who is it?"

Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke/говорил/. As usual when he was
indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat/сидел/ down next to Harry,
took/взял/ one look at him, and burst/взрыв/ into tears.

"It's -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault!" he sobbed, his face in his hands.
I told the evil git how ter/тер/ get past Fluffy/пушистый/! I told him! It was the only
thing he didn't know, an' I told him! Yeh could've died! All fer/фер/ a
dragon egg! I'll never drink again! I should be chucked out an' made ter/тер/
live as a Muggle!"

"Hagrid!" said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking/сотрясение/ with grief and
remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard/борода/. "Hagrid, he'd have
found out somehow/как-то/, this is Voldemort we're talking about, he'd have
found out even if you hadn't told him."

"Yeh could've died!" sobbed Hagrid. "An' don' say the name!"

"VOLDEMORT!" Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped
crying. "I've met him and I'm calling him by his name. Please cheer up,
Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it's gone, he can't use it. Have a Chocolate
Frog, I've got loads...."

Hagrid wiped his nose/нос/ on the back of his hand and said, "That reminds
me. I've got yeh a present."

"It's not a stoat sandwich, is it?" said Harry anxiously, and at last
Hagrid gave/дал/ a weak chuckle. "Nah. Dumbledore gave/дал/ me the day off
yesterday ter/тер/ fix it. 'Course, he shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway/так или иначе/,
got yeh this..."

It seemed/казалось/ to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it
curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him
from every page were his mother and father.

"Sent owls/совы/ off ter/тер/ all yer/Ер/ parents' old school friends, askin' fer/фер/
photos... knew yeh didn' have any... d'yeh like it?"

Harry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood.

Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone/в одиночестве/ that night. He
had been held/Ручной/ up by Madam Pomfrey/Помфрей/'s fussing about, insisting on giving
him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked
out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's
winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner
showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind/за/ the High Table.

When Harry walked in there was a sudden/внезапный/ hush, and then everybody started
talking loudly/громко/ at once. He slipped/поскользнулся/ into a seat between Ron and Hermione
at the Gryffindor table and tried/пытался/ to ignore the fact that people were
standing/постоянный/ up to look at him.

Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away/далеко/.

"Another year gone!" Dumbledore said cheerfully. "And I must trouble/беда/ you
with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our
delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads/руководители/ are all a
little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead/впереди/ to get
them nice and empty before next year starts....

"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the
points stand/стоять/ thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and
twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff/хаффлпаффец/, with three hundred and fifty-two;
Ravenclaw/Рейвенкло/ has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred
and seventy- two."

A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.
Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a
sickening sight/взгляд/.

"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin," said Dumbledore. "However, recent
events must be taken/взятый/ into account."

The room went/отправился/ very still/все еще/. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little.

"Ahem," said Dumbledore. "I have a few last-minute points to dish out.
Let me see. Yes...

"First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley/Уизли/..."

Ron went/отправился/ purple/пурпурный/ in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.

"...for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I
award Gryffindor house fifty points."

Gryffindor cheers nearly raised/поднятый/ the bewitched ceiling/потолок/; the stars
overhead seemed/казалось/ to quiver. Percy could be heard/услышанным/ telling/говоря/ the other
prefects, "My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past
McGonagall's giant/гигант/ chess set!"

At last there was silence again.

"Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the
face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points."

Hermione buried her face in her arms/оружие/; Harry strongly suspected she had
burst/взрыв/ into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside
themselves/самих себя/ -- they were a hundred points up. "Third -- to Mr. Harry
Potter..." said Dumbledore. The room went/отправился/ deadly quiet/тихо/ for pure nerve
and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points."

The din was deafening. Those/те/ who could add up while yelling themselves/самих себя/
hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points
-- exactly/в точку/ the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup -- if
only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.

Dumbledore raised/поднятый/ his hand. The room gradually fell/упал/ silent.

"There are all kinds of courage," said Dumbledore, smiling. "It takes a
great deal of bravery to stand/стоять/ up to our enemies, but just as much to
stand/стоять/ up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville
Longbottom."

Someone/кто то/ standing/постоянный/ outside the Great Hall might well have thought/думал/ some
sort of explosion had taken/взятый/ place, so loud/громкий/ was the noise that erupted
from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood/стоял/ up to yell and
cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared/исчез/ under a pile/свая/ of people
hugging him. He had never won/выиграл/ so much as a point for Gryffindor before.
Harry, still/все еще/ cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed/заостренный/ at Malfoy, who
couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the
Body-Bind Curse/проклятие/ put on him.

"Which means, Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even
Ravenclaw/Рейвенкло/ and Hufflepuff/хаффлпаффец/ were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, "we
need a little change of decoration."

He clapped/захлопала/ his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became/стал/ scarlet
and the silver became/стал/ gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a
towering Gryffindor lion took/взял/ its place. Snape was shaking/сотрясение/ Professor
McGonagall's hand, with a horrible/какой ужас/, forced smile. He caught/пойманный/ Harry's eye
and Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward/к/ him hadn't changed
one jot. This didn't worry Harry. It seemed/казалось/ as though/хоть/ life would be back
to normal next year, or as normal as it ever/Когда-либо/ was at Hogwarts.

It was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at
Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would
never, ever/Когда-либо/ forget/забывать/ tonight.

Harry had almost/почти/ forgotten/забытый/ that the exam results were still/все еще/ to come, but
come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed/прошло/ with good
marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even
Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his
abysmal Potions/зелий/ one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost/почти/ as stupid
as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed/прошло/, too. It was a
shame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything/все/ in life.

And suddenly/вдруг, внезапно/, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed,
Neville's toad/жаба/ was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were
handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the
holidays ("I always hope they'll forget/забывать/ to give us these/эти/," said Fred
Weasley/Уизли/ sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats
that sailed across/через/ the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express;
talking and laughing as the countryside became/стал/ greener and tidier;
eating Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns;
pulling off their wizard robes/робы/ and putting on jackets and coats; pulling
into platform nine and three-quarters at King's Cross Station.

It took/взял/ quite/довольно/ a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened
old guard was up by the ticket barrier/барьер/, letting them go through the gate
in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out
of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.

"You must come and stay this summer," said Ron, "both of you -- I'll
send you an owl/сова/."

"Thanks," said Harry, "I'll need something to look forward to." People
jostled them as they moved forward toward/к/ the gateway back to the Muggle
world. Some of them called:

"Bye, Harry!"

"See you, Potter!"

"Still/все еще/ famous," said Ron, grinning at him.

"Not where I'm going, I promise you," said Harry.

He, Ron, and Hermione passed/прошло/ through the gateway together. "There he is,
Mom, there he is, look!"

It was Ginny Weasley/Уизли/, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing/указательный/ at
Ron.

"Harry Potter!" she squealed. "Look, Mom! I can see

"Be quiet/тихо/, Ginny, and it's rude to point."

Mrs. Weasley/Уизли/ smiled down at them.

"Busy year?" she said.

"Very," said Harry. "Thanks for the fudge and the sweater/свитер/, Mrs.
Weasley/Уизли/."

"Oh, it was nothing, dear."

"Ready, are you?"

It was Uncle Vernon, still/все еще/ purple/пурпурный/-faced, still/все еще/ mustached, still/все еще/ looking
furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying/проведение/ an owl/сова/ in a cage in a station
full of ordinary people. Behind/за/ him stood/стоял/ Aunt Petunia and Dudley,
looking terrified at the very sight/взгляд/ of Harry.

"You must be Harry's family!" said Mrs. Weasley/Уизли/.

"In a manner of speaking," said Uncle Vernon. "Hurry/торопиться/ up, boy, we haven't
got all day." He walked away/далеко/.

Harry hung/висела/ back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.

"See you over the summer, then."

"Hope you have -- er/эр/ -- a good holiday," said Hermione, looking
uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone/кто угодно/ could be so
unpleasant.

"Oh, I will," said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was
spreading over his face. "They don't know we're not allowed to use magic
at home. I'm going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer...."
